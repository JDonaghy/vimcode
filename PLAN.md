# VimCode Implementation Plan

> Session history archived in **SESSION_HISTORY.md**. Recent work summary in **PROJECT_STATE.md**.

---

## Recently Completed
- **Session 187**: Tab Context Menu Splits Fix — Fixed GTK/TUI split inconsistency (GTK was creating editor groups, engine was doing window splits); added 4 split options (Split Right/Down for Vim splits, Split Right/Down to New Group for editor groups); README 3-layer explainer; 4 new tests (4498 total).
- **Session 186**: Drag-and-Drop File Move + Context Menu Clamping — TUI mouse drag + GTK DragSource/DropTarget; confirmation dialog with clickable buttons; fixed GTK dialog button misalignment (proportional vs monospace font); subtree move prevention; context menu popup z-order fix; 6 new tests (4468 total).
- **Session 185**: Context Menu Action Polish + Bug Fixes — Select for Compare / Compare with Selected diff flow; fixed GTK copy_relative_path and open_side bugs; fixed "Open to Side" creating 2 tab groups; fixed swap file "Abort" not deleting swap; fixed xdg-open stderr corrupting TUI; fixed "Open in Integrated Terminal" (TUI noop + GTK missing); `terminal_new_tab_at()` for directory-specific terminals; deduplicated TUI action handlers; 8 new tests (4468 total).

## Roadmap
- [x] **Spell checker** — Vim-compatible `]s`/`[s`/`z=`/`zg`/`zw`; spellbook Hunspell parser; bundled en_US dictionary; tree-sitter-aware; `spell`/`spelllang` settings; user dictionary at `~/.config/vimcode/user.dic`
- [x] Add the ability to resize tabgroups: i.e. the leftgroup gets bigger at the right's expense and vice-versa. Also should work for vertically stacked tab groups, as well as with both the mouse and via key combos that are remappable in both tui and gui mode.
- [x] Implement version querying so that the semantic version and build number can be displaced via Help:About and by typing "vcd --version" which shows the version but doesn't start the editor.
### Git
- [x] **Stage hunks** — `]c`/`[c` navigation, `gs`/`:Ghs` to stage hunk under cursor
- [x] **Inline diff peek** — `gD`/`:DiffPeek`/gutter click shows hunk popup with Revert/Stage, deleted-line `▾` gutter marker, `]c`/`[c` on real files

### Editor Features
- [x] **`:set` command** — runtime setting changes; write-through to settings.json; number/rnu/expandtab/tabstop/shiftwidth/autoindent/incsearch; query with `?`

### UI & Menus
- [x] **VSCode-style menus** — application menu bar (File / Edit / View / Go / Run / Terminal / Help) in GTK; command palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P`) lists all commands + key bindings; fuzzy-searchable; both GTK native menus and TUI pop-up menu overlay (sessions 81–82, 100–101)

- [x] **Settings editor** — `:Settings` opens `settings.json` in an editor tab; Settings sidebar panel shows live values; auto-reload on save in both backends (session 117)
- [x] **Settings sidebar (GTK + TUI)** — interactive form with 32 settings in 8 categories, search, live controls; GTK native widgets (session 117b/117c), TUI interactive form with keyboard nav + inline editing (session 147)

### Extension System
- [x] **Extension mechanism** — Lua 5.4 plugin sandbox; plugins register commands/keymaps/hooks, read/write buffer text, show messages; `~/.config/vimcode/plugins/` auto-loaded; bundled language-pack extensions + GitHub registry; `:ExtInstall/:ExtList/:ExtEnable/:ExtDisable/:ExtRemove` (sessions 98, 113–114)
- [x] **Keymap editor in settings panel** — "User Keymaps" row in the Settings sidebar opens a scratch buffer (one keymap per line, format `mode keys :command`). `:w` validates, updates `settings.keymaps`, calls `rebuild_user_keymaps()`. Also accessible via `:Keymaps` command. Tab shows `[Keymaps]`. GTK button + TUI "N defined ▸". 11 tests. (session 154)
- [x] **Extension Panel API** — `vimcode.panel.register/set_items/parse_event` Lua API for custom sidebar panels; `PanelRegistration`/`ExtPanelItem`/`ExtPanelStyle` types; `panel_focus/panel_select/panel_action` events; dynamic activity bar icons; GTK + TUI rendering; git-insights Git Log panel (Branches/Log/Stash) as first consumer; `vimcode.git.branches()`; 17 tests (session 165)

### AI Integration

- [x] **AI inline completions** — ghost-text completions from AI provider interleaved with LSP ghost text; separate `ai_completions` setting (default false to avoid unexpected API costs); debounced after 500ms idle in insert mode; Tab accepts whole suggestion, `Alt-]`/`Alt-[` cycle through alternatives
- [x] **Swap file crash recovery** — Vim-like swap files (`~/.config/vimcode/swap/`); FNV-1a path hashing; atomic writes (`.tmp` + rename); PID-based stale detection; `[R]ecover/[D]elete/[A]bort` recovery dialog; `:set swapfile`/`:set updatetime=N`; periodic writes via `tick_swap_files()`; cleanup on shutdown

### Context Menus
- [x] **Context menu action polish** — Two-step "Select for Compare" → "Compare with 'file'" diff flow; fixed GTK copy_relative_path and open_side bugs; engine-driven action handling; 8 new tests

### Explorer
- [x] **Drag-and-drop file/folder move** — Drag files and folders in the explorer tree to move them to a new location. Should work in both TUI (mouse drag) and GTK (native DnD) backends. Visual feedback during drag (insertion indicator, highlight target folder). Confirmation dialog with clickable buttons.
- [ ] **Inline rename in explorer** — Rename files/folders directly in the explorer tree (as close to in-place editing as possible), rather than via a separate prompt. In GTK this can be a native editable cell; in TUI, render an input field overlaid on the tree row.
- [ ] **Copy/paste files in explorer** — "Copy" and "Paste" items in the right-click context menu. Copy stores the source path; Paste into a different folder duplicates with the same name, Paste into the same folder prompts for a new name (inline in the tree). Support both single files and folders (recursive copy).
- [x] **Context menu popup clamping** — TUI context menu popup rendering moved after status/command line in draw order so popups are no longer painted over by lower UI elements. Position clamping ensures popup stays within terminal bounds.

### Robustness
- [ ] **Centralize context menu definitions** — GTK backend hardcodes its own `gio::Menu` items separately from the engine's `open_explorer_context_menu()` / `open_tab_context_menu()`. This causes drift (e.g. "Open in Integrated Terminal" was missing from GTK). GTK should read from the engine's `ContextMenuState.items` to build its native menus, so new items only need to be added once in the engine.
- [ ] **Subprocess stderr safety audit** — Audit all `Command::spawn()` calls across the codebase to ensure stdout/stderr are redirected (null or piped). Unguarded spawns let child process output corrupt the TUI display. Fixed `xdg-open`/`open` calls; need to verify LSP, DAP, git, terminal, and any other subprocess spawns are safe.
