## Active wave — `quadraui` cross-platform UI crate extraction

Extracting a reusable UI crate from vimcode per
[`docs/UI_CRATE_DESIGN.md`](docs/UI_CRATE_DESIGN.md). vimcode is the
test app; target downstream apps include a cross-platform k8s dashboard
(see issue [#145](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/145)).

**Release baseline:** `v0.10.0` (on `main`).

**Development branch:** `develop` — all new work starts here.

A.1c and A.2c need a Windows machine. A.2b and A.3c-2 are **unblocked**
on Linux now that A.3d shipped cursor-aware `TextInput`. Both are
architectural migrations from native GTK widgets to `DrawingArea` +
`quadraui_gtk::draw_form`/`draw_tree` — medium-large scope each.
The lower-risk GTK stages (A.1b, A.4b, A.5b) are all done; the
remaining Linux queue is A.3c-2 and A.2b.

Design decisions covering primitive-distinctness (why `ListView` is
separate from `TreeView`, and how `DataTable` #140 should be scoped)
are documented in [`docs/DECISIONS_quadraui_primitives.md`](docs/DECISIONS_quadraui_primitives.md).

## Lessons learned during this wave

- **Adapters must preserve the flat-row count the engine expects.** The
  first draft of `source_control_to_tree_view()` added a `(no changes)`
  placeholder row for empty + expanded sections. That single extra row
  shifted the `sc.selected` (flat index) → `selected_path` (TreePath)
  mapping off by one, and `sc_flat_to_section_idx()` disagreed with the
  visual layout. Symptom: `Tab` and `Enter` acted on the wrong section;
  staging worked only because the file rows were always in non-empty
  sections. Fix (absorbed into `e12601e`): drop the placeholder. Rule:
  **any adapter row the engine doesn't count is a bug.** Backends that
  want an empty-state hint should render it as a visual detail that
  doesn't occupy a selectable row.

- **Flat-index selection mapping is the single biggest regression risk**
  in every backend migration. Always smoke-test keyboard nav (`j`/`k`)
  after touching an adapter. If the highlight visually lands on a
  non-header row but key behaviour says otherwise, the adapter has
  added or dropped a row.

- **Branches are not automatically headers.** Early `draw_tree`
  implementations (TUI + GTK) applied section-header background styling
  to every branch row (any row with `is_expanded = Some(_)`). That was
  correct for SC (branches are section titles) but wrong for the
  explorer (branches are just directories and should look like sibling
  files). Fix (absorbed into `1c4bbd7`): added `Decoration::Header`.
  Apps tag header rows explicitly; backends style them distinctly.
  `is_expanded`-ness is now purely about chevron rendering. Rule:
  **tree hierarchy and visual emphasis are orthogonal.**

## Picking this up on another machine

### 1. Initial clone / sync

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JDonaghy/vimcode.git
cd vimcode
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

Confirm tip matches the `bac137e` (or newer) commit recorded in the table
above. If newer, scan recent commits for any completed stage and update
this file.

### 2. Workspace layout

### 3. Build and test commands

Platform-agnostic:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test --no-default-features   # required pre-commit/pre-release gate
cargo build
```

Platform-specific builds:

| Platform | Build target | Command |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Linux / macOS GUI | `vimcode` (GTK) | `cargo build` (default `gui` feature) |
| Any | `vcd` (TUI) | `cargo build --bin vcd --no-default-features` |
| Windows native | `vimcode-win` | `cargo build --bin vimcode-win --features win-gui --no-default-features` |
| Windows lint | `vimcode-win` | `cargo clippy --features win-gui --no-default-features` |

**🚫 CRITICAL — NEVER run `cargo test` with `--features win-gui`.** It
spawns hundreds of real Win32 windows and locks up the machine. See
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) Testing section for details.

### 4. Development workflow

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) "Development Workflow" for the full rules.
Summary:

1. Always branch off `develop` (never commit directly to `develop`).
2. Commit locally; do **not** push until the user has smoke-tested or
   explicitly waived smoke testing.
3. Two landing paths: (A) fast-forward merge + push for small/trivial
   changes; (B) push branch + PR for normal work. Default to B when unsure.

---

## Phase A.3 — `Form` primitive + settings panel

**Branch:** `quadraui-phase-a3-form-settings` off `develop`.

**Platform:** any — settings panel exists in TUI and GTK.

**Why this is next (reordered ahead of A.2b):** A.2b (GTK explorer) needs
a text-input primitive for inline rename / new-entry. Building A.2b
before Form/TextInput exists would mean dialog fallbacks and re-work
when the primitive later lands, so we let the catalog catch up first.

**Scope — new primitives in `quadraui`:**

- `Form` — container primitive holding labeled field rows.
- Field types for v1 baseline: `Toggle` (bool), `TextInput` (string),
  `Button`. (Richer fields — `Dropdown`, `Slider`, `ColorPicker` —
  tracked in #143 and defer to a follow-up.)
- `FormEvent` variants: `ToggleChanged { id, value }`,
  `TextInputChanged { id, value }`, `ButtonClicked { id }`, plus
  `KeyPressed { key, modifiers }` for app-level routing.
- All types owned + serde-compatible per plugin invariants (§10).

**Scope — migration:**

1. Define `quadraui::primitives::form` with the types above.
2. Add `draw_form()` in each TUI + GTK backend (Win-GUI deferred).
3. New adapter `settings_to_form()` in `src/render.rs` — converts
   `Engine.settings` state into a `quadraui::Form` description.
4. TUI `render_settings_panel()` in `src/tui_main/panels.rs` — replace
   with `draw_form()` call when no special state is active.
5. GTK settings panel (it exists imperatively, not via a native widget) —
   replace with `draw_form()` call.
6. Keyboard navigation between fields: Tab / arrows / typing for
   `TextInput` focus; Space to toggle; Enter to activate buttons.
7. Scroll for long settings lists (primitive-owned? or app-owned as in A.1/A.2).

**Out of scope for A.3:**

- `Dropdown`, `Slider`, `ColorPicker` fields (tracked in #143). Enum-valued
  settings keep using text-input + validation until #143 lands.
- Settings search / filter input (can reuse the `TextInput` primitive,
  though).
- Win-GUI port (follow-up stage A.3c).

**Reference implementations:** None yet — Form is a brand-new primitive.
The `TreeView` primitive (`quadraui/src/primitives/tree.rs`) is the
template for shape (data struct + event enum + backend draw function).

**Smoke test after implementing:**

```bash
cargo run --bin vcd    # TUI
cargo run              # GUI
```

- Settings panel renders with current values
- Tab / arrow keys move between fields
- Toggle settings flip with Space
- Text input fields accept typing, Backspace, Enter commits, Escape cancels
- Button rows dispatch the expected engine action

**Rough size estimate:** Larger than A.1a/A.1b (~600–900 lines) because
Form is a new primitive with more event surface than TreeView.

---

## Phase A.2b — GTK explorer (replaces native `gtk4::TreeView`)

**Status:** 🟡 Unblocked as of A.3d (`f7f3a51`). The `Form` primitive
now supports cursor-aware `TextInput`, which means the explorer's
inline rename and new-entry rows can render an embedded `TextInput`
inside a `TreeRow` without dialog fallbacks.

Pickup content below is the full plan.

---


**Branch:** `quadraui-phase-a2b-treeview-explorer-gtk` off `develop`.

**Platform:** Linux or macOS with GTK4 (4.10+).

**This is the biggest architectural migration in all of Phase A.** Unlike
the SC panel (A.1b), which was already rendered into a `DrawingArea`,
the GTK explorer today uses a **native `gtk4::TreeView` widget with a
`TreeStore` model**. Migrating means tearing out the native widget
entirely and rendering the explorer into a `DrawingArea` via
`quadraui_gtk::draw_tree`.

**What the native widget provides today (that we lose by default):**

- Built-in vertical scrolling with kinetic inertia
- Native keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Left/Right/Page-Up/Down/Home/End)
- Right-click context menu integration
- Accessibility tree exposed to screen readers / AT-SPI
- Native drag-and-drop handles
- Row focus outline, hover states

A.2b reimplements **only what's needed right now** on top of the
primitive. The rest defers to later quadraui stages (context menus,
a11y, drag-drop).

**Scope:**

1. Find the GTK explorer widget setup in `src/gtk/mod.rs` (search for
   `TreeView::new()` or similar) and the associated `TreeStore` /
   `ListStore` construction. Remove them.
2. Replace with a `DrawingArea` sized and placed the same way as the
   SC sidebar panel (and the existing explorer).
3. Add an `explorer_to_tree_view()` adapter in `src/gtk/draw.rs` (or
   `src/render.rs` if it should be shared — TUI's version currently
   lives in `src/tui_main/panels.rs`, so consider lifting it to
   `render.rs` for reuse). **Same adapter output as TUI A.2a** —
   `quadraui::TreeView` with `Decoration::Header` only on sections
   (explorer has none, so dirs stay `Decoration::Normal`).
4. Wire the DrawingArea's draw callback to call
   `quadraui_gtk::draw_tree()` with the adapted tree.
5. Re-wire click handling: the old `TreeView` widget dispatched
   `row-activated` / `cursor-changed` signals. Now clicks land on the
   DrawingArea; compute `row = (click_y / item_height)` and update
   `sidebar.selected`, then call existing engine methods to
   open/toggle/etc. Use `src/tui_main/mouse.rs` explorer click handling
   as the reference.
6. Re-wire keyboard handling: capture Key controller events on the
   DrawingArea, dispatch `j/k/l/h/Enter/Escape` to the same engine
   methods the TUI uses. Use `src/tui_main/mod.rs` lines 2640-2760
   as the reference.
7. Add a scrollbar overlay (mirror what the TUI does in
   `render_explorer_scrollbar` — or use a Cairo version of the same
   thumb-and-track pattern).

**Special-mode handling (rename / new-entry):** same pattern as TUI's
A.2a: when `engine.explorer_rename.is_some()` or
`engine.explorer_new_entry.is_some()`, fall through to a legacy path.
For the GTK migration, the "legacy path" will need to be written
because the old native-widget code won't exist any more. Options:
(a) render the edit input as a GTK `Entry` widget overlaid on the
relevant row, or (b) defer rename/new-entry to a stage after Form
lands. **Recommendation:** option (b) — keep A.2b focused on baseline
rendering. Mark rename/new-entry as unavailable in GTK during A.2b
(the TUI keeps working). Restore them after `Form` / `TextInput`
primitive lands.

**Reference implementations:**
- `src/tui_main/panels.rs::explorer_to_tree_view` (adapter)
- `src/tui_main/panels.rs::render_sidebar` (rendering dispatch, special-mode branch)
- `src/tui_main/quadraui_tui.rs::draw_tree` (rendering template, TUI)
- `src/gtk/quadraui_gtk.rs::draw_tree` (rendering template, GTK — already exists for SC)

**Pre-flight reading:**
- [`docs/NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS.md`](docs/NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS.md) — lessons
  from the Win-GUI build. Click geometry vs. draw geometry mismatches
  (§5) are the most likely class of bug when wiring the DrawingArea.

**Smoke test after implementing:**

```bash
cargo run   # default GUI
```

1. Explorer panel renders on launch — tree of files and dirs, icons,
   indent, chevrons.
2. `j`/`k` moves selection through all visible rows.
3. `l`/Enter on a file opens it in the editor.
4. `l`/Enter on a dir toggles expand/collapse.
5. `h` on an expanded dir collapses it; `h` at root unfocuses (matches
   TUI behaviour).
6. Scrollbar updates as selection / content changes.
7. Git indicators (M/A/D) appear right-aligned on modified files.
8. Diagnostics: errors/warnings badge on files with LSP diagnostics.
9. Mouse click on any row selects it.
10. **Known regressions** vs. old native widget (document clearly if
    they affect users):
    - Inline rename (deferred)
    - Drag-and-drop (deferred — wasn't in TUI either)
    - Context menus (deferred to A.x)
    - Accessibility tree (deferred — v1.1 per design §7.6)

**Out of scope for A.2b:**

- `TreeEvent` routing (still direct-to-engine for Phase A)
- Primitive-owned scroll state
- Context menus
- Inline rename (falls under Form primitive)
- Native drag-and-drop

---

## Phase A.1c — Win-GUI `draw_tree`

**Branch:** `quadraui-phase-a1c-treeview-win-gui` off `develop`.

**Platform:** Windows with MSVC build tools + Rust stable. Needed because
Direct2D/DirectWrite bindings only build under `target_os = "windows"`.

**Setup on Windows:**

```powershell
# Install Rust via rustup.rs (default toolchain = stable-msvc)
# Install Git for Windows
git clone git@github.com:JDonaghy/vimcode.git
cd vimcode
git checkout develop
cargo build --bin vimcode-win --features win-gui --no-default-features
```

Running: `.\target\debug\vimcode-win.exe` (or use `cargo run --bin vimcode-win --features win-gui --no-default-features`).

**Scope:**

1. Create `src/win_gui/quadraui_win.rs` with a `draw_tree` function that
   takes a Direct2D render target, area rect, the `TreeView`, and theme.
2. Port the TUI reference to Direct2D + DirectWrite: row background fill
   (`FillRectangle`), chevron (`DrawText`), icon, styled spans, badge.
3. In `src/win_gui/mod.rs` (wherever the SC panel is drawn — search for
   `draw_source_control_panel` or similar), replace the section loop with
   a call to `render::source_control_to_tree_view()` + `quadraui_win::draw_tree`.
4. Click handling stays on the existing path (event routing is later).

**Pre-flight reading (MANDATORY):**

- [`docs/NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS.md`](docs/NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS.md) — every lesson
  from the initial Win-GUI build. The tab-bar breadcrumb offset bug (§1)
  and the draw/click geometry mismatch (§5) are classes of bugs likely to
  recur in TreeView rasterisation.
- [`src/tui_main/quadraui_tui.rs`](src/tui_main/quadraui_tui.rs) — reference
  implementation.

**Smoke test after implementing:**

- Launch `vimcode-win.exe`.
- Open the git panel.
- Verify sections, chevrons, icons, selection highlight.
- Verify click-to-open, keyboard nav, Tab expand/collapse, `s` to stage.
- Multi-group layouts don't break (§2 of NATIVE_GUI_LESSONS).

**Win-GUI-specific constraints:**

- NEVER run `cargo test` with `--features win-gui` (spawns real windows).
- Clippy: `cargo clippy --features win-gui --no-default-features`.
- Build the binary: `cargo build --bin vimcode-win --features win-gui --no-default-features`.

## Design invariants that must hold across all stages

From [`docs/UI_CRATE_DESIGN.md`](docs/UI_CRATE_DESIGN.md) §10
(plugin-driven UI invariants). Breaking any of these would force a breaking
quadraui API change when Lua plugins start declaring UI (see issues
[#146](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/146) and
[#147](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/147)).

1. **`WidgetId` is owned** (`String` / `Cow<'static, str>`) — not `&'static str`.
2. **Events are plain data**, not Rust closures.
3. **Primitive structs implement `Serialize + Deserialize`** so Lua tables
   can map via JSON.
4. **WidgetId namespacing** for plugin IDs (e.g. `"plugin:my-ext:send"`).
5. **No global event handlers** — every event references a `WidgetId`.
6. **Primitives don't borrow app state** (owned data or explicit `'a`
   lifetimes).

If you write a new primitive or extend an existing one, verify all six.
