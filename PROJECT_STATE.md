# VimCode Project State

**Last updated:** May 5, 2026 (Session 351 — **All bespoke paint surfaces eliminated.** #301 menu bar, #310 command center, #302 search panel shipped. Also #290 + #291 extension panel bug fixes).

## Active milestone: Cross-Platform UI Crate

**This is the current top priority.** All quadraui primitive migrations must complete before moving to other milestones. The goal is zero bespoke per-backend code — every UI surface paints, scrolls, and handles clicks through quadraui's shared API. Win-GUI is deferred until quadraui implements that backend.

**All bespoke paint surfaces are now eliminated.** The last two surfaces (#301 menu bar, #302 search panel) shipped this session. Every UI surface in both TUI and GTK now paints through quadraui primitives.

**Remaining milestone work** is consolidation and infrastructure:

| # | Title | Category |
|---|-------|----------|
| [#307](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/307) | Scroll dispatch migration | Consolidation |
| [#295](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/295) | TUI MSV scrollbar drag-to-scroll | Polish |
| [#294](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/294) | quadraui MSV horizontal axis rasterisers | Infrastructure |
| [#308](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/308) | Menu bar keyboard/hover dispatch gaps | Polish |
| [#311](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/311) | Search panel arrow key cursor movement | Polish |
| [#312](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/issues/312) | Ctrl-Shift-F visual selection prepopulate | Feature |

**Shipped this session:**
- **#301** (PR #309, `5baadcc`) — Menu bar labels → `quadraui::MenuBar`. Both backends paint through quadraui rasterisers. Click/hover via cached `MenuBarLayout::hit_test()`.
- **#310** (`b5fdd7d`) — Nav arrows + search box → `quadraui::CommandCenter`. Eliminated ~242 lines of per-backend rendering + click code. GTK window drag preserved.
- **#302** (multiple commits ending `de625bb`) — Search panel → `quadraui::MSV + Form + TreeView`. TUI: ~321 lines bespoke paint + ~86 lines click → zero. GTK: ~226 lines native widgets → DrawingArea + same MSV pipeline. Replace All now has confirmation dialog. quadraui gained ToggleGroup + ButtonRow (quadraui#52), full-width Form fields (quadraui#54), GTK Pango-based form_layout (quadraui#56).
- **#290** (`0a8f46f`) — TUI extension panel search input no longer drops r/i/d/q// characters.
- **#291** (`924aa24`) — Arrow keys navigate extension panel results while search input active.

**Previous session (350):** #305 terminal toolbar shipped; quadraui gained rect-height-aware tab bar + compact mode.

Vimcode at 1952 lib + 2040 integration tests passing on develop@`de625bb`. Both TUI + GTK build + clippy clean.

> Feature documentation lives in **README.md**.
> Per-session implementation notes through Session 348 are in **SESSION_HISTORY.md**.
> **Active multi-stage wave:** `quadraui` cross-platform UI crate extraction — see **PLAN.md** for pickup-on-another-machine instructions.

## Testing Policy

**Every new Vim feature and every bug fix MUST have comprehensive integration tests before the work is considered done.** Subtle bugs (register content, cursor position, newline handling, linewise vs. char-mode paste) are only reliably caught by tests. The process is:

1. Write failing tests that document the expected Vim behavior
2. Implement/fix the feature until all tests pass
3. Run the full suite (`cargo test`) — no regressions allowed

When implementing a new key/command, add tests covering:
- Basic happy path
- Edge cases: start/middle/end of line, start/end of file, empty buffer, count prefix
- Register content (text and `is_linewise` flag)
- Cursor position after the operation
- Interaction with paste (`p`/`P`) to verify the yanked/deleted content behaves correctly

## Cross-backend coverage

Snapshot of where each surface stands on its quadraui primitive.
TUI was the reference implementation through Phase C; GTK caught
up. Numbers update with each Path-A landing — read this to find
the next slice.

**Status (post #296, 2026-05-02):** **TUI/GTK paint duplication is
done.** Every entry in the cross-backend coverage table below is ✅
on both backends. Debug sidebar migrated to `MultiSectionView`
(#296) — both paint and click consume one cached layout per frame.
**No bespoke section-walk paint code remains.** Residual convergence
work (#210/#211/#288-style hit-test/click items) plus
intrinsic-to-surface divergences (Cairo painter order vs ratatui
cell coalescence) remain but are tracked separately.

| Surface | Primitive | TUI | GTK | Notes |

| Editor hover popup (markdown + code-hl + selection + scroll + links) | `RichTextPopup` | ✅ | ✅ | #214 shipped (`c8a23e9`); rasterisers lifted via #266 (`779f6e8`). Both backends consume `quadraui::{tui,gtk}::draw_rich_text_popup`. |
| Completion popup | `Completions` | ✅ | ✅ | #285 — GTK lifted to `quadraui::gtk::draw_completions` |
| Editor scrollbar (v + h paint) | `Scrollbar` | ✅ | ✅ | #277, `fbbc85f`+ |

| Extension panel | `TreeView` (with `Decoration::Header`) | ✅ | ✅ | #280, `d29d1b4`. Adapter `render::ext_sidebar_to_tree_view`. Click via `TreeViewLayout::hit_test()` on both backends. |
| Debug sidebar (variables tree, breakpoints, watch) | `MultiSectionView` (4 × `TreeView`) | ✅ | ✅ | #296, `285916b`. Adapter `render::debug_sidebar_to_multi_section_view`. Paint caches layout; click reads verbatim. |
| Source control panel | `TreeView` (with `Decoration::Header`) | ✅ | ✅ | #282 already shipped — `render::source_control_to_tree_view` adapter + `Backend::draw_tree` on both backends. Table previously claimed bespoke; reconciled here. |

| Search panel (chrome + results) | `MSV` + `Form` + `TreeView` | ✅ | ✅ | #302, `de625bb`. Adapter `render::build_search_panel_msv`. Form: query/replace TextInput + ToggleGroup + ButtonRow. Tree: file-grouped results. Click via `backend.form_layout`/`backend.tree_layout`. Replace All has confirmation dialog. |

**Cross-backend logic-sharing** (where one implementation drives both backends):

- All primitive `Layout` algorithms (`StatusBarLayout`, `PaletteLayout`, etc.) — single implementation, both backends consume.
- `quadraui::dispatch_mouse_down/drag/up` + `ModalStack` + `DragState` — drives palette drag, picker drag, TUI sidebar scrollbar drag, and GTK explorer scrollbar drag (as of `3e5d7d3`).
- Engine-side hit-region builders (`compute_find_replace_hit_regions`) and cell-unit fit algorithms (`StatusBar::fit_right_start`, `TabBar::fit_active_scroll_offset`) — parameterised over a measurement closure so each backend supplies its native unit.
- `core::settings::SAVE_REVISION` — one source of truth both file watchers consult (#201).
- All `*_to_form` / `*_to_tree_view` / `lsp_status_for_buffer` adapters in `render.rs` and `core/engine/`.

**North-star ("developer doesn't need to know the backend") status after B.5:**

- ✅ True for picker / status-bar / tree / dialog / context-menu / tooltip-shaped surfaces — adding a new instance means writing data + handlers, never touching Pango/cells.
- ✅ True for **rich-document** popups since #214 shipped + #266 lifted both rasterisers — adding new rich popups means writing a `RichTextDocument` and handlers, never touching Pango/cells.
- ⚠️ **Hit-test glue still per-backend** (#210) — primitive layouts and `hit_test` methods are shared, but the wires from "mouse moved" → "selected_idx changed" are still hand-rolled in each backend's motion handler. Several bugs across the B.5 wave traced back to this (slice 6 row-height drift, slice 8 hand-rolled char-width math). Structural fix: motion handlers should call `layout.hit_test()` directly. The same shape exists in #211 (debug sidebar) and likely a few other surfaces.
- ❌ No `Backend::watch_file(path) -> Stream<FileEvent>` trait method — every backend rolls its own watcher (TUI poll, GTK GIO, future Win-GUI `ReadDirectoryChangesW`). Suppress decision is shared (#201) but not the watcher invocation.
- ✅ **Editor viewport lifted** (Phase C Stage 1 / #276). Both backends paint through `quadraui::{tui,gtk}::draw_editor`. The vim-motion-suite vision (PLAN.md) is now unblocked at the paint layer; engine-slice extraction (Phase 2 — `editor_core` crate carving out `keys.rs` + buffer + LSP) remains as a separate multi-month wave.
- ⏭️ Win-GUI has TreeView / Explorer / StatusBar / TabBar but most of B.3+ hasn't reached Windows. "Cross-platform" currently means ~1.5 platforms.
