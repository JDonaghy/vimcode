# VimCode Project State

**Last updated:** Apr 16, 2026 (Session 283 — Fix 3 Vim deviations: visual J, :%join, insert Ctrl-U) | **Tests:** 1761 (lib) + 270 (nvim conformance)

> Feature documentation lives in **README.md**.
> Per-session implementation notes through Session 279 are in **SESSION_HISTORY.md**.

## Testing Policy

**Every new Vim feature and every bug fix MUST have comprehensive integration tests before the work is considered done.** Subtle bugs (register content, cursor position, newline handling, linewise vs. char-mode paste) are only reliably caught by tests. The process is:

1. Write failing tests that document the expected Vim behavior
2. Implement/fix the feature until all tests pass
3. Run the full suite (`cargo test`) — no regressions allowed

When implementing a new key/command, add tests covering:
- Basic happy path
- Edge cases: start/middle/end of line, start/end of file, empty buffer, count prefix
- Register content (text and `is_linewise` flag)
- Cursor position after the operation
- Interaction with paste (`p`/`P`) to verify the yanked/deleted content behaves correctly

## Recent Work

**Session 283 — Fix 3 Vim deviations (#97, #98, #99):**

1. **Fix #97: Visual line J now joins selected lines** — Added `J` handler in visual mode operator dispatch. `VjjJ` correctly joins all selected lines.
2. **Fix #98: :%join range now supported** — Added `%` range prefix handling in `execute_command()`. Also supports `%d` and `%y`.
3. **Fix #99: Ctrl-U in insert mode respects insert point** — Added `insert_enter_col` field to track where insert mode was entered. Ctrl-U now deletes only back to that boundary instead of line start.
4. **Closed #65** (already fixed in session 282, issue left open).
5. **4 previously-ignored tests now passing** (1757 → 1761 lib tests).

**Session 282 — Insert paste fix (#65), Phase 4 batches 10-11 (#25), 8 deviations fixed:**

1. **Fix #65: Ctrl-V paste in insert mode added cumulative indentation** — `paste_in_insert_mode()` was applying auto-indent to each pasted line, causing a staircase effect. Fixed by suppressing auto-indent during paste (pasted text already has its own whitespace).
2. **Phase 4 batches 10-11 (#25): 58 new Neovim-mined tests** — Mined from test_undo.vim, test_change.vim, test_put.vim, test_marks.vim, test_registers.vim, test_join.vim. Covering: undo/redo (5), put/paste (7), change operations (11), text objects (9), marks (4), registers (6), macros (2), join edge cases (5), insert mode keys (3), changelist navigation (2).
3. **Fixed 8 Vim deviations**: Vc/Vjc visual line change ate trailing newline; r\<CR\> was a no-op; S didn't preserve indent; daw at end of line didn't consume leading whitespace; tick mark jump ('a) went to col 0 instead of first non-blank; feed_keys didn't drain macro playback queue; updated test_visual_line_change to correct Vim expectation.
4. **3 new deviations documented** (ignored tests): visual J in line mode, :%join range not supported, Ctrl-U in insert deletes to line start instead of insert start.
