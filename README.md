# VimCode

High-performance Vim+VSCode hybrid editor in Rust. Modal editing meets modern UX, no GPU required.

### Who's this for?

If you like Vim and you like VSCode, but Vim isn't VSCode-enough and VSCode isn't Vim-enough for you, then this might be the editor for you. It can run in a terminal and look like Vim but behave like VSCode when you need it. Alternatively, it can run in a window and look like VSCode but behave like Vim when you need it. Easily switch from Vim-mode to VSCode-mode at any time simply by pressing `Alt-m`. 

**Extensions** are available, but note that these are not VSCode extensions or Vim plugins. VimCode takes a "batteries-included" approach, so many features just work out of the box. Both **LSP** and **DAP** protocols are supported, and extensions for 17 languages are available from the [vimcode-ext](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode-ext) registry. New extensions can be added to the registry without updating VimCode itself.

There is no VimScript or TypeScript support for extensions. Instead, like Neovim, VimCode supports **Lua** for writing extensions. However, the API is very different from Neovim’s, so its plugins will not work. There is also no GPU acceleration (like Zed), as the goal was for VimCode to work everywhere.

### Status
VimCode has been shamelessly "vibe-coded" using **Claude Code**, and development has proceeded very quickly as a result. I am beginning to use it on a daily basis, but at this stage, it is still very much **alpha software**. Use at your own risk. 

Bug reports are welcome and will be fed to Claude—as long as there is enough detail to recreate the problem and describe the expected behavior. I am also open to feature requests that are well-described and align with the project's vision.

## Vision

- **First-class Vim mode** — deeply integrated, not a plugin
- **Cross-platform** — GTK4 desktop UI + full terminal (TUI) backend
- **CPU rendering** — Cairo/Pango (works in VMs, remote desktops, SSH)
- **Clean architecture** — platform-agnostic core, 4715 tests, zero async runtime dependency

> **Note:** VimCode does not implement VimScript. Extension and scripting is handled via
> the built-in Lua 5.4 plugin system. The goal is full Vim *keybinding* and *editing*
> compatibility, not a VimScript runtime. For a detailed Vim compatibility checklist, see [VIM_COMPATIBILITY.md](VIM_COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Download (Linux)

Pre-built packages are published automatically on every push to `main`:

**[→ Download latest release](../../releases/tag/latest)**

**Option A — `.deb` package (recommended for Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i vimcode_*.deb
sudo apt -f install   # pulls in any missing GTK4 runtime libraries
```
Requires **Ubuntu 24.04+** or any distro with **GTK 4.10+**. The `.deb` handles all runtime dependencies automatically.

**Option B — raw binary**
```bash
# First install runtime dependencies:
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libglib2.0-0 libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2
# Then run:
chmod +x vimcode-linux-x86_64
./vimcode-linux-x86_64
```

**Option C — Flatpak**
```bash
flatpak install vimcode.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.jdonaghy.VimCode
```
The Flatpak bundles GTK4 and all dependencies — works on any Linux distro with Flatpak installed.

> **Note:** Ubuntu 22.04 ships GTK 4.6 which is too old for the `.deb` and raw binary; use the Flatpak or upgrade to 24.04+.

## Building

### Prerequisites

VimCode requires **GTK4 development libraries** for the GUI backend. The TUI mode (`--tui`) works without GTK4 — only a terminal emulator is needed.

| Platform | Install command |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev build-essential pkg-config` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gcc pkg-config` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S gtk4 base-devel pkgconf` |
| openSUSE | `sudo zypper install gtk4-devel gcc pkg-config` |
| macOS | `brew install gtk4 pkg-config` |
| Windows (MSYS2) | `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4 mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc` |

**Platform notes:**
- **macOS:** GTK4 works via Homebrew; this is not a native AppKit app. See [Homebrew install](#homebrew-macos) below
- **Windows:** Use the MSYS2 MinGW64 shell and set `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
- **Nerd Font recommended:** VimCode uses Nerd Font icons throughout the UI — the file explorer, activity bar, tab bar, terminal toolbar, and debug panel all rely on Nerd Font glyphs. Install any [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (e.g. JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, FiraCode Nerd Font) and set it as your terminal font (TUI) or configure `font_family` in `settings.json` (GTK). Without a Nerd Font, icons will display as missing-glyph boxes.

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap JDonaghy/vimcode
brew install vimcode    # GTK4 GUI + TUI (installs both `vimcode` and `vcd`)
brew install vcd        # TUI only (no GTK4 dependency)
```

### Build & run

```bash
cargo build
cargo run -- <file>                         # GTK window
cargo run -- --tui <file>                   # Terminal UI (alias: -t)
cargo run -- --tui --debug /tmp/v.log       # TUI with debug log
cargo run -- --version                      # Print version and exit (alias: -V)
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
```

**Visual mode**
- `v` — character selection; `V` — line selection; `Ctrl-V` — block selection
- All operators work on selection: `d`, `c`, `y`, `u`, `U`, `~`, `p`/`P` (paste replaces selection)
- `"{reg}p` — paste from named register over selection (deleted text goes to unnamed register)
- Block mode: rectangular selections, change/delete/yank uniform columns

- `o` — swap cursor to opposite end of selection (character/line visual)
- `O` — swap cursor to opposite column corner (visual block)
- `gv` — reselect last visual selection
- `r{char}` — replace all selected characters with `{char}`

**Search**
- `/` — forward incremental search (real-time highlight as you type)
- `?` — backward incremental search
- `n` / `N` — next/previous match (direction-aware; re-highlights after Escape)
- `Escape` in normal mode clears search highlights (same as `:noh`)
- `Escape` during search cancels and restores cursor position

**Marks**
- `m{a-z}` — set file-local mark; `m{A-Z}` — set global (cross-file) mark
- `'{a-z}/{A-Z}` — jump to mark line; `` `{a-z}/{A-Z} `` — jump to exact mark position

- Marks stored per-buffer (lowercase) or globally with filepath (uppercase)

**Macros**
- `q{a-z}` — start recording into register; `q` — stop
- `@{a-z}` — play back; `@@` — repeat last; `{N}@{a}` — play N times
- Records all keys: navigation, Ctrl combos, special keys, Insert mode content, search

**Registers & Clipboard**
- `"` — unnamed (default)
- `"{a-z}` — named registers (`"ay` yank into `a`, `"ap` paste from `a`)
- `"+` / `"*` — system clipboard registers (`"+y` yank to clipboard, `"+p` paste from clipboard)
- `"0` — yank-only register; every yank sets it, deletes do not
- `"1`–`"9` — delete history; each linewise/multi-line delete shifts 1→2→…→9
- `"-` — small-delete register; character-wise deletions less than one full line
- `"%` — current filename (read-only)
- `"/` — last search pattern (read-only)
- `".` — last inserted text (read-only)
- `"_` — black hole register (discard without affecting other registers)
- Registers preserve linewise/characterwise type
- `Ctrl-Shift-V` — paste system clipboard in Normal/Visual/Insert/Command/Search mode (GTK + TUI with keyboard enhancement)

**Find/Replace**
- `:s/pattern/replacement/[flags]` — substitute on current line
- `:%s/pattern/replacement/[flags]` — all lines
- `:'<,'>s/...` — visual selection range
- Flags: `g` (global), `i` (case-insensitive)
- `Ctrl-F` — VSCode-style dialog (live search, replace, replace all)
- Full undo/redo support

**Multiple Cursors**
- `Alt-D` (default) — add a secondary cursor at the next occurrence of the word under the cursor; press again to add the next match
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` (default) — add a cursor at **every** occurrence of the word under the cursor at once
- `Ctrl+Click` — plant a secondary cursor at the clicked position
- Enter insert mode and type — all cursors receive identical edits simultaneously
- `Escape` collapses all extra cursors and exits insert mode
- Keybindings configurable via `panel_keys.add_cursor` and `panel_keys.select_all_matches` in `settings.json`
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` requires a terminal with Kitty keyboard protocol support (Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, foot) in TUI mode

**Code Folding**
- `za` — toggle fold; `zo` — open; `zc` — close; `zR` — open all
- Indentation-based fold detection
- `+` / `-` gutter indicators; entire gutter column is clickable
- Fold state is per-window (two windows on same buffer can have different folds)

**Spell Checking**
- `:set spell` / `:set nospell` — enable/disable; also togglable via "Toggle Spell Check" in the command palette
- Misspelled words shown with a cyan dotted underline (wavy dots in GTK, colored underline in TUI)
- **Tree-sitter aware:** in code files only comments and strings are checked; in plain-text and Markdown files the whole buffer is checked
- `]s` / `[s` — jump to next/previous spelling error
- `z=` — show spelling suggestions for word under cursor (displayed in status bar)
- `zg` — add word under cursor to the user dictionary (`~/.config/vimcode/user.dic`)
- `zw` — mark word as wrong (add to wrong-word list)
- Bundled en_US dictionary (Hunspell-compatible, compiled into the binary); `spelllang` setting selects the language (only `en_US` currently bundled)

**Hunk navigation (diff buffers)**
- `]c` / `[c` — jump to next/previous change region (uses diff results in side-by-side view, `@@` headers in unified diff, git diff markers otherwise)

### Multi-File Editing

VimCode has three spatial layers that combine Vim and VSCode concepts:
- **Windows** — Vim-style splits *within* a single tab (`:split`, `:vsplit`, `Ctrl-W s/v`)
- **Tabs** — pages within an editor group, like Vim tabs or browser tabs (`gt`/`gT`, `:tabnew`)
- **Editor Groups** — VSCode-style side-by-side tab bars (`Ctrl+\`, `Ctrl-W e/E`), each with its own set of tabs

The tab context menu offers both: "Split Right/Down" creates a Vim window split inside the current tab, while "Split Right/Down to New Group" creates a new editor group with its own tab bar.

**Buffers**
- `:bn` / `:bp` — next/previous buffer
- `:b#` — alternate buffer
- `:ls` — list buffers (shows `[Preview]` suffix for preview tabs)
- `:bd` — delete buffer

**Windows** (splits within the current tab — not to be confused with Editor Groups)
- `:split` / `:vsplit` — horizontal/vertical split
- `:close` — close window; `:only` — close all other windows
- `Ctrl-W h/j/k/l` — move focus between panes (or `:wincmd h/j/k/l`)
- `Ctrl-W w` — cycle focus; `Ctrl-W c` — close; `Ctrl-W o` — close others
- `Ctrl-W s/v` — split (same as `:split`/`:vsplit`)

**Tabs**
- `:tabnew` — new tab; `:tabclose` — close tab
- `gt` / `gT` or `g` + `t` / `T` — next/previous tab
- `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` — MRU tab switcher popup (cycles most-recently-used tabs; Enter confirms, Escape cancels); release modifier to auto-confirm (GTK)
- `Alt+t` — MRU tab switcher (works in both TUI and GTK; hold Alt and press `t` to cycle; release Alt or wait 500ms to confirm in TUI)

**Editor Groups / Tab Groups (VSCode-style split panes, recursive)**
- `Ctrl+\` — split editor right (any group can be split again for nested layouts)
- `Ctrl-W e` / `Ctrl-W E` — split editor right / down
- `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` — focus group by position (tree order)
- `:EditorGroupFocus` / `:egf` — cycle focus to the next group
- `:EditorGroupClose` / `:egc` — close the active group (sibling promoted)
- `:EditorGroupMoveTab` / `:egmt` — move the current tab to the next group
- `Alt+,` / `Alt+.` — shrink / expand the active group (both GTK and TUI)
- Drag any group divider — resize that specific split (both GTK and TUI)
- Drag a tab to another group's tab bar — move it there (both GTK and TUI)
- Drag a tab to the edge of an editor area — create a new split (both GTK and TUI)

**Quit / Save**
- `:w` — save; `:wq` — save and quit
- `:q` — close tab (quits if last tab; blocked if dirty unless visible in another split)
- `:q!` — force-close tab
- `:qa` / `:qa!` — close all tabs (blocked / force)
- `Ctrl-S` — save in any mode without changing mode

---

### Project Search

- `Alt+F` — focus search panel (or click the search icon in the activity bar)
- Type a query and press `Enter` to search all text files under the project root
- Respects `.gitignore` rules (powered by the `ignore` crate — same walker as ripgrep)
- Hidden files/directories and binary files are skipped; results capped at 10,000
- Results are grouped by file (`filename.rs`) then listed as `  42: matched line text`
- **Toggle buttons** (VS Code style):
  - `Aa` — Match Case (case-sensitive search)
  - `Ab|` — Match Whole Word (`\b` word boundaries)
  - `.*` — Use Regular Expression (full regex syntax)
- **Replace across files:** type replacement text in the Replace input; click "Replace All" (GTK) or press `Enter` in the replace box / `Alt+H` (TUI) to substitute all matches on disk
  - Regex mode: `$1`, `$2` capture group backreferences work in replacement text
  - Literal mode: `$` in replacement is treated literally (no backreference expansion)
  - Files with unsaved changes (dirty buffers) are skipped and reported in the status message
  - Open buffers for modified files are automatically reloaded from disk after replace
- **GTK:** click toggle buttons below the search input; click a result to open the file; `Tab` or click to switch between search/replace inputs
- **TUI:** `Alt+C` (case), `Alt+W` (whole word), `Alt+R` (regex), `Alt+H` (replace all); `Tab` to switch between search/replace inputs; `j`/`k` to navigate results; `Enter` to open

---

### Unified Picker (Telescope-Style)

VimCode uses a unified picker system for file finding, live grep, and command palette. All pickers share the same UI and keybindings. Fuzzy match characters are highlighted in the results.

#### Fuzzy File Finder

- `Ctrl-P` or `<leader>sf` (Normal mode) — open the fuzzy file picker
- A centered floating modal appears over the editor
- Type to instantly filter all project files by fuzzy subsequence match
- Word-boundary matches (after `/`, `_`, `-`, `.`) are scored higher; `.gitignore`-aware via `ignore` crate
- `Ctrl-N` / `↓` and `Ctrl-P` / `↑` — navigate results; `Enter` — open selected file; `Escape` — close

#### Live Grep

- `Ctrl-Shift-F` or `<leader>sg` (Normal mode) — open the live grep picker
- A centered floating two-column modal appears over the editor
- Type to instantly search file *contents* across the entire project (live-as-you-type, query ≥ 2 chars)
- Left pane shows results in `filename.rs:N: snippet` format; right pane shows ±5 context lines around the match
- Match line is highlighted in the preview pane
- `Ctrl-N` / `↓` and `Ctrl-P` / `↑` — navigate results; preview updates as you move; `Enter` — open file at match line; `Escape` — close
- Results capped at 200; uses `.gitignore`-aware search (same engine as project search panel)

#### Command Palette

- `Ctrl-Shift-P` / `F1` or `<leader>sp` (Normal mode) — open the command palette picker
- Lists all commands with descriptions and current keybindings; type to fuzzy-filter

---

### Quickfix Window

- `:grep <pattern>` / `:vimgrep <pattern>` — search project and populate the quickfix list; opens panel automatically
- `:copen` / `:cope` — open the quickfix panel with focus (shows all matches)
- `:cclose` / `:ccl` — close the quickfix panel
- `:cn` / `:cnext` — jump to next match (opens file, positions cursor)
- `:cp` / `:cprev` / `:cN` — jump to previous match
- `:cc N` — jump to Nth match (1-based)
- The quickfix panel is a **persistent bottom strip** (6 rows) above the status bar — not a floating modal
- When open with focus (`j`/`k`, `Ctrl-N`/`Ctrl-P` → navigate; `Enter` → jump and return focus to editor; `q`/`Escape` → close)

---

### Integrated Terminal

- `Ctrl-T` (Normal mode) — toggle the integrated terminal panel
- `:term` / `:terminal` — open a **new terminal tab** (always spawns a fresh shell, even if the panel is already open)
- The terminal is a **resizable bottom strip** (default 1 toolbar + 12 content rows) above the status bar; drag the header row up/down to resize; height persists across sessions
- Shell is determined by the `$SHELL` environment variable, falling back to `/bin/bash`; starts in the editor's working directory
- Full **ANSI/VT100 color support** — 256-color xterm palette rendered cell-by-cell
- **Multiple terminal tabs** — each tab runs an independent PTY; the toolbar shows `[1] [2] …` labels:
  - `Alt-1` through `Alt-9` (when terminal has focus) — switch to tab N
  - Click a `[N]` tab label in the toolbar — switch to that tab
  - Click the close icon (`󰅖`) — close the active tab; closes the panel if it was the last tab
  - When a shell exits (Ctrl-D, `exit`), its tab closes automatically
- **Mouse selection** — click and drag to select text in the terminal content area
- **Copy / Paste:**
  - `Ctrl-Y` — copy the current mouse selection to the system clipboard
  - `Ctrl-Shift-V` — paste from system clipboard into the running shell (GTK: intercepted by vimcode; TUI: Alacritty/kitty bracketed-paste is forwarded to the PTY automatically)
  - Mouse-release auto-copies the selection to the clipboard (requires `xclip` or `xsel` on Linux/X11)
- **Scrollback** — PageUp / PageDown scroll into history (up to 5 000 rows by default); the scrollbar is draggable; configurable via `"terminal_scrollback_lines"` in `settings.json`
- **Find in terminal** — `Ctrl-F` (while terminal has focus) opens an inline find bar in the toolbar row:
  - Type to set the query; matching text highlights live (orange = active match, amber = other matches)
  - `Enter` — next match; `Shift+Enter` — previous match; `Escape` or `Ctrl-F` — close find bar
  - Search is case-insensitive; covers all visible rows and the full scrollback history
- **Horizontal split** — click `󰤼` in the toolbar (or `Ctrl-W` when split is active) to toggle a side-by-side two-pane view:
  - Click either pane or press `Ctrl-W` to switch keyboard focus between panes
  - Drag the `│` divider left/right to resize the panes; both PTYs are resized on mouse release
- **Nerd Font toolbar** — tab strip + split (`󰤼`) and close (`󰅖`) icons
- **All keys forwarded to shell PTY** — Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-L, Ctrl-Z, arrow keys, Tab, etc. work as expected
- `Ctrl-T` while the terminal has focus **closes the panel** while keeping all shell sessions alive; reopening restores the same sessions
- When a shell exits (Ctrl-D, `exit`, etc.) its tab closes immediately; the panel closes automatically when the last tab exits; clicking outside the terminal returns focus to the editor

### Debugger (DAP)

Built-in Debug Adapter Protocol support with a VSCode-like UI. Open the debug sidebar (click the bug icon), set breakpoints with `F9`, and press `F5` to start debugging. Supports 6 adapters: codelldb (Rust/C/C++), debugpy (Python), delve (Go), js-debug (JS/TS), java-debug (Java), netcoredbg (C#). Install with `:DapInstall <lang>`.

The debug sidebar has four sections: Variables, Watch, Call Stack, and Breakpoints. Breakpoints support conditions, hit counts, and logpoints. A `launch.json` is auto-generated on first run.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F5` | Start / continue |
| `Shift+F5` | Stop |
| `F9` | Toggle breakpoint |
| `F10` / `F11` | Step over / into |
| `Shift+F11` | Step out |

For full details on adapters, launch.json, conditional breakpoints, and the debug sidebar, see the **[DAP Debugger Setup](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/DAP-Debugger-Setup)** wiki page.

2. `]c` / `[c` — navigate between hunks
3. `gs` or `:Ghs` — stage the hunk under the cursor via `git apply --cached`

---

### Source Control Panel

Click the git branch icon in the activity bar to open the Source Control panel — a VSCode-style panel showing the full working tree status. The header shows the current branch plus ↑N↓N ahead/behind counts.

**Commit input row** (always visible, below the header):
- `c` — enter commit message input mode (row highlights, `|` cursor appears)
- Type your message; `BackSpace` deletes; `Escape` exits input mode (message is preserved)
- `Enter` — inserts a newline (multi-line commit messages; input box grows in height)
- `Ctrl+Enter` — commits staged changes with the typed message (clears message on success)

**Four expandable sections** (Tab to collapse/expand):
- **Staged Changes** — files indexed for the next commit (`A` added, `M` modified, `D` deleted, `R` renamed)
- **Changes** — unstaged modifications and untracked files
- **Worktrees** — all git worktrees with ✓ marking the current one (hidden when no linked worktrees exist)
- **Recent Commits** — last 20 commit messages (`Enter` on an entry shows its hash + message in the status bar)

**Navigation and file actions:**
- `j` / `k` — move selection up/down
- `s` — stage/unstage the selected file; on a **section header**: stage all (Changes) or unstage all (Staged Changes)
- `d` — discard unstaged changes for the selected file (`git checkout -- <path>`)
- `D` — on the **Changes section header**: discard all unstaged changes (`git restore .`)
- `r` — refresh the panel
- `Enter` — open the selected file in the editor / switch to the selected worktree
- `Tab` — collapse/expand the current section
- `q` / `Escape` — return focus to the editor

**Branch operations:**
- `b` — open branch picker (fuzzy-filter, `Enter` to switch, `Escape` to cancel)
- `B` — create a new branch (type name, `Enter` to create + switch)

**Remote operations (from panel):**
- `p` — push current branch
- `P` — pull current branch
- `f` — fetch

**Help:**
- `?` — show keybindings help dialog (any key closes it)

**Worktree and remote commands:**

| Command | Alias | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `:GWorktreeAdd <branch> <path>` | — | Add a new git worktree at `<path>` for `<branch>` |
| `:GWorktreeRemove <path>` | — | Remove the worktree at `<path>` |
| `:Gpull` | `:Gpl` | Pull current branch |
| `:Gfetch` | `:Gf` | Fetch |

---

### Git Log Panel

The Git Log panel (provided by the `git-insights` extension) shows branches, commit history, and stashes in a dedicated sidebar panel. Commits are expandable tree nodes — expanding a commit reveals the files it changed.

**Commit interaction:**
- `Tab` — expand/collapse commit to show changed files
- `o` — open side-by-side diff for the selected file (within an expanded commit)
- `y` — copy commit hash (on a commit) or file path (on a file)
- `b` — open commit in browser (GitHub/GitLab)
- `r` — refresh the log
- `d` — pop stash (on a stash entry)
- `p` — push stash
- `/` — activate search/filter input field
- `K` / `Enter` — show hover popup with commit details (author, date, message, stat)

**Blame-to-panel navigation:** The `:Gshow <hash>` command navigates to the Git Log panel and expands the specified commit, replacing the old scratch-buffer behavior. This is also triggered by "Open Commit" links in blame hover popups.

---

### Workspaces

A `.vimcode-workspace` file at the project root captures per-project settings and enables session restoration. Workspace settings overlay your global `settings.json`. Sessions (open files, cursor positions) are stored per-directory and restored automatically.

**Commands:** `:OpenFolder <path>`, `:OpenWorkspace <path>`, `:SaveWorkspaceAs <path>`, `:cd <path>`, `:OpenRecent`

See the **[Settings Reference](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/Settings-Reference)** wiki page for workspace file format and session details.

---

### Lua Plugin Extensions

VimCode embeds Lua 5.4 (fully vendored — no system Lua required). Plugins live in `~/.config/vimcode/plugins/` as `.lua` files or directories with `init.lua`. The `vimcode.*` global provides APIs for buffer manipulation, event hooks, custom commands, keymaps, settings, git operations, and custom sidebar panels.

**Example** (`~/.config/vimcode/plugins/hello.lua`):
```lua
vimcode.command("Hello", function(args)
  vimcode.message("Hello from Lua! " .. args)
end)

vimcode.on("save", function(path)
  vimcode.message("Saved: " .. path)
end)
```

**Command URIs** — Hover popup markdown supports `[label](command:Name?args)` links that dispatch to plugin commands registered with `vimcode.command()`. Arguments are percent-decoded automatically.

**Commands:** `:Plugin list` | `:Plugin reload` | `:Plugin enable <name>` | `:Plugin disable <name>`

For the full API reference, see the **[Lua Plugin API](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/Lua-Plugin-API)** wiki page.

---

### Language Extensions

Language extensions bundle an LSP server, optional DAP debugger, and Lua scripts into a single package. Install with `:ExtInstall <name>`. Extensions are fetched from the [vimcode-ext](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode-ext) registry and cached locally.

Browse extensions in the sidebar (click the extensions icon in the activity bar). You can also develop and test extensions locally — see the **[Extension Development](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/Extension-Development)** wiki page.

---

### AI Assistant

Built-in AI chat panel supporting Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or local Ollama. Click the chat icon in the activity bar to open. Configure `ai_provider` and `ai_api_key` in `settings.json` (or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` env vars).

- `i` — enter input mode; type and press `Enter` to send
- `:AI <message>` — send from command mode; `:AiClear` — clear history
- **AI inline completions** — set `ai_completions: true` for ghost-text suggestions in insert mode (`Tab` accepts, `Alt-]`/`Alt-[` cycle alternatives)

---

### LSP Support (Language Server Protocol)

Automatic language server integration — open a file and diagnostics, completions, go-to-definition, and hover just work if the server is on `PATH`. Install language support via `:ExtInstall <lang>`.

**Features:** inline diagnostics, `]d`/`[d` navigation, auto-popup completions (`Ctrl-Space` manual trigger), `gd` definition, `gr` references, `gi` implementation, `gy` type definition, `K` hover, `gh` editor hover popup, signature help, `<leader>gf` format, `<leader>rn` rename, `<leader>ca` code actions, lightbulb gutter indicator, semantic token highlighting.

**Commands:** `:LspInfo` | `:LspRestart` | `:LspStop` | `:Lformat` | `:Rename <name>` | `:CodeAction`

For custom server configuration and troubleshooting, see the **[LSP Configuration](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/LSP-Configuration)** wiki page.

### VSCode Mode

Switch the editor into a **non-modal editing** mode that works like a standard text editor:

- `:set mode=vscode` — activate VSCode mode (from Vim normal mode)
- `Alt-M` — toggle between Vim mode and VSCode mode at any time
- `:set mode=vim` — return to Vim mode

**In VSCode mode:**
- Always in "insert" state — no mode switching
- `Ctrl-C` / `Ctrl-X` — copy / cut (no selection → copies/cuts whole current line)
- `Ctrl-V` — paste
- `Ctrl-Z` / `Ctrl-Y` — undo / redo
- `Ctrl-A` — select all
- `Ctrl-S` — save
- `Ctrl-/` — toggle line comment (language-aware, 46+ languages)
- `Shift+Arrow` — extend selection one character/line at a time
- `Ctrl+Arrow` — move by word
- `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` — extend selection by word
- `Home` — smart home (first non-whitespace; again → col 0)
- `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` — extend selection to line start/end
- `Escape` — clear selection (stays in insert)
- `Ctrl-Q` — quit
- `F1` — command palette (search and run any command)
- `F10` — toggle menu bar visibility
- Typing while a selection is active **replaces** the selection
- Status bar shows `EDIT  F1:palette  Alt-M:vim` (or `SELECT` when text is selected, `COMMAND` in command bar)

**Line Operations (Phase 1):**
- `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` — move line or selection up/down
- `Alt+Shift+Up` / `Alt+Shift+Down` — duplicate line or selection up/down
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` — delete entire line
- `Ctrl+Enter` — insert blank line below (cursor stays)
- `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` — insert blank line above (cursor stays)
- `Ctrl+L` — select current line (repeat to extend)

**Multi-Cursor + Indentation (Phase 2):**
- `Ctrl+D` — select word under cursor; repeat to add next occurrence
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` — select all occurrences of the current word
- `Ctrl+]` — indent line/selection
- `Ctrl+[` — outdent line/selection
- `Shift+Tab` — outdent

**Quick Navigation + Panels (Phase 3):**
- `Ctrl+G` — go to line number
- `Ctrl+P` — quick file open (fuzzy finder)
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `F1` — command palette
- `Ctrl+B` — toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl+J` — toggle terminal panel
- `` Ctrl+` `` — toggle terminal panel
- `Ctrl+,` — open settings

VSCode mode supports the same `:map` remapping system as Vim mode — see the **[Key Remapping](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/Key-Remapping)** wiki page. The `editor_mode` setting is persisted in `settings.json`.

---

### Session Persistence

All state lives in `~/.config/vimcode/`. Open files, cursor positions, command/search history, window geometry, and explorer state are restored on startup. Per-project sessions are stored separately when using workspaces. See the **[Settings Reference](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode/wiki/Settings-Reference)** wiki page for details.

---

### Rendering

**Syntax highlighting** (Tree-sitter, auto-detected by extension)
- Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Go, C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Bash, Lua, JSON, TOML, CSS, YAML, HTML, Markdown

**Line numbers** — absolute / relative / hybrid (both on = hybrid)

**Scrollbars** (GTK + TUI)
- Per-window vertical scrollbar with cursor position indicator
- Per-window horizontal scrollbar (shown when content is wider than viewport)
- Scrollbar click-to-jump and drag support

**Font** — configurable family and size via `settings.json`

---

### TUI Backend (Terminal UI)

Full editor in the terminal via ratatui + crossterm — feature-parity with GTK.

- **Layout:** activity bar (3 cols) | sidebar | editor area; status line + command line full-width at bottom
- **Sidebar:** same file explorer as GTK with Nerd Font icons
- **Mouse support:** click-to-position, double-click word select, click-and-drag visual selection, window switching, scroll wheel (targets pane under cursor), scrollbar click-to-jump and drag; drag event coalescing for smooth scrollbar tracking; bracketed paste support
- **Sidebar resize:** drag separator column; `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` keyboard resize (min 15, max 60 cols)
- **Scrollbars:** `█` / `░` thumb/track in uniform grey; vsplit separator doubles as left-pane vertical scrollbar; horizontal scrollbar row when content wider than viewport; `┘` corner when both axes present
- **Scroll sync:** `:Gblame` pairs stay in sync across keyboard nav and mouse events
- **Frame rate cap:** renders limited to ~60fps so rapid LSP or search events don't peg the CPU
- **Cursor shapes:** bar `|` in Insert mode, underline `_` in replace (`r`)

`dictionaries/` — bundled en_US Hunspell dictionary files (`.aff` + `.dic`) compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!`.


## Acknowledgements
VimCode is built on the shoulders of giants, and I take very little credit for it. Credit belongs instead to the following people and teams:

*   **Bram Moolenaar (RIP):** The original author of Vim. If you use VimCode and want to give something back, you can honor his legacy by donating to a charity of your choice. See [moolenaar.net/Charityware.html](https://www.moolenaar.net). I personally believe in the mission of UNICEF. No pressure!
*   **The VSCode Team:** Obviously.
*   **Bill Joy:** The creator of the original vi editor.
*   **LLM Pioneers:** I also feel the need to begrudgingly acknowledge the work done by those who helped create LLMs (too many to mention). I say "begrudgingly" because of the horrors of "AI Slop" unleashed on the world, not to mention the environmental concerns regarding power-hungry data centers. That said, I remain hopeful that AI will be a catalyst for generating unlimited clean energy and many other benefits as well. I just hope that too many people won't suffer because of the incredible pace of the disruption.
*   **Boris Cherny:** The creator of **Claude Code**, who is probably putting all of us developers out of a job any day now.
