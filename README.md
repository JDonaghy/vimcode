# VimCode

High-performance Vim+VSCode hybrid editor in Rust. Modal editing meets modern UX, no GPU required.

### Who's this for?

If you like Vim and you like VSCode, but Vim isn't VSCode-enough and VSCode isn't Vim-enough for you, then this might be the editor for you. It can run in a terminal and look like Vim but behave like VSCode when you need it. Alternatively, it can run in a window and look like VSCode but behave like Vim when you need it. Easily switch from Vim-mode to VSCode-mode at any time simply by pressing `Alt-m`. 

**Extensions** are available, but note that these are not VSCode extensions or Vim plugins. VimCode takes a "batteries-included" approach, so many features just work out of the box. Both **LSP** and **DAP** protocols are supported, and extensions for 17 languages are available from the [vimcode-ext](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode-ext) registry. New extensions can be added to the registry without updating VimCode itself.

There is no VimScript or TypeScript support for extensions. Instead, like Neovim, VimCode supports **Lua** for writing extensions. However, the API is very different from Neovim’s, so its plugins will not work. There is also no GPU acceleration (like Zed), as the goal was for VimCode to work everywhere.

### Status
VimCode has been shamelessly "vibe-coded" using **Claude Code**, and development has proceeded very quickly as a result. I am beginning to use it on a daily basis, but at this stage, it is still very much **alpha software**. Use at your own risk. 

Bug reports are welcome and will be fed to Claude—as long as there is enough detail to recreate the problem and describe the expected behavior. I am also open to feature requests that are well-described and align with the project's vision.

## Vision

- **First-class Vim mode** — deeply integrated, not a plugin
- **Cross-platform** — GTK4 desktop UI + full terminal (TUI) backend
- **CPU rendering** — Cairo/Pango (works in VMs, remote desktops, SSH)
- **Clean architecture** — platform-agnostic core, 4088 tests, zero async runtime dependency

> **Note:** VimCode does not implement VimScript. Extension and scripting is handled via
> the built-in Lua 5.4 plugin system. The goal is full Vim *keybinding* and *editing*
> compatibility, not a VimScript runtime. For a detailed Vim compatibility checklist, see [VIM_COMPATIBILITY.md](VIM_COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Download (Linux)

Pre-built packages are published automatically on every push to `main`:

**[→ Download latest release](../../releases/tag/latest)**

**Option A — `.deb` package (recommended for Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i vimcode_*.deb
sudo apt -f install   # pulls in any missing GTK4 runtime libraries
```
Requires **Ubuntu 24.04+** or any distro with **GTK 4.10+**. The `.deb` handles all runtime dependencies automatically.

**Option B — raw binary**
```bash
# First install runtime dependencies:
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libglib2.0-0 libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2
# Then run:
chmod +x vimcode-linux-x86_64
./vimcode-linux-x86_64
```

**Option C — Flatpak**
```bash
flatpak install vimcode.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.jdonaghy.VimCode
```
The Flatpak bundles GTK4 and all dependencies — works on any Linux distro with Flatpak installed.

> **Note:** Ubuntu 22.04 ships GTK 4.6 which is too old for the `.deb` and raw binary; use the Flatpak or upgrade to 24.04+.

## Building

### Prerequisites

VimCode requires **GTK4 development libraries** for the GUI backend. The TUI mode (`--tui`) works without GTK4 — only a terminal emulator is needed.

| Platform | Install command |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu/Debian | `sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev build-essential pkg-config` |
| Fedora | `sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gcc pkg-config` |
| Arch | `sudo pacman -S gtk4 base-devel pkgconf` |
| openSUSE | `sudo zypper install gtk4-devel gcc pkg-config` |
| macOS | `brew install gtk4 pkg-config` |
| Windows (MSYS2) | `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4 mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc` |

**Platform notes:**
- **macOS:** GTK4 works via Homebrew; this is not a native AppKit app
- **Windows:** Use the MSYS2 MinGW64 shell and set `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

### Build & run

```bash
cargo build
cargo run -- <file>                         # GTK window
cargo run -- --tui <file>                   # Terminal UI (alias: -t)
cargo run -- --tui --debug /tmp/v.log       # TUI with debug log
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
```

**Insert mode**
- `i` / `I` — insert at cursor / line start
- `a` / `A` — append at cursor / line end
- `o` / `O` — open line below/above
- **Auto-popup completion** — suggestion popup appears automatically as you type; `Tab` accepts highlighted item; `Ctrl-N`/`Ctrl-P` or `Down`/`Up` cycle candidates without inserting; `Left`/`Escape` or any non-completion key dismisses; sources: buffer word scan (sync) + LSP (async)
- `Ctrl-Space` — manually trigger (or re-trigger) completion popup; configurable via `completion_keys.trigger`

- All operators work on selection: `d`, `c`, `y`, `u`, `U`, `~`, `p`/`P` (paste replaces selection)
- `"{reg}p` — paste from named register over selection (deleted text goes to unnamed register)
- Block mode: rectangular selections, change/delete/yank uniform columns

- `A` (block) — append text after right edge of block (applied to all lines on Escape)
- `o` — swap cursor to opposite end of selection (character/line visual)
- `O` — swap cursor to opposite column corner (visual block)
- `gv` — reselect last visual selection
- `r{char}` — replace all selected characters with `{char}`

**Search**
- `/` — forward incremental search (real-time highlight as you type)
- `?` — backward incremental search
- `n` / `N` — next/previous match (direction-aware; re-highlights after Escape)
- `Escape` in normal mode clears search highlights (same as `:noh`)
- `Escape` during search cancels and restores cursor position

**Marks**

- Records all keys: navigation, Ctrl combos, special keys, Insert mode content, search

**Registers & Clipboard**
- `"` — unnamed (default)
- `"{a-z}` — named registers (`"ay` yank into `a`, `"ap` paste from `a`)
- `"+` / `"*` — system clipboard registers (`"+y` yank to clipboard, `"+p` paste from clipboard)
- `"0` — yank-only register; every yank sets it, deletes do not
- `"1`–`"9` — delete history; each linewise/multi-line delete shifts 1→2→…→9
- `"-` — small-delete register; character-wise deletions less than one full line
- `"%` — current filename (read-only)
- `"/` — last search pattern (read-only)
- `".` — last inserted text (read-only)
- `"_` — black hole register (discard without affecting other registers)
- Registers preserve linewise/characterwise type
- `Ctrl-Shift-V` — paste system clipboard in Normal/Visual/Insert/Command/Search mode (GTK + TUI with keyboard enhancement)

**Find/Replace**
- `:s/pattern/replacement/[flags]` — substitute on current line
- `:%s/pattern/replacement/[flags]` — all lines
- `:'<,'>s/...` — visual selection range
- Flags: `g` (global), `i` (case-insensitive)
- `Ctrl-F` — VSCode-style dialog (live search, replace, replace all)
- Full undo/redo support

**Multiple Cursors**
- `Alt-D` (default) — add a secondary cursor at the next occurrence of the word under the cursor; press again to add the next match
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` (default) — add a cursor at **every** occurrence of the word under the cursor at once
- `Ctrl+Click` — plant a secondary cursor at the clicked position
- Enter insert mode and type — all cursors receive identical edits simultaneously
- `Escape` collapses all extra cursors and exits insert mode
- Keybindings configurable via `panel_keys.add_cursor` and `panel_keys.select_all_matches` in `settings.json`
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` requires a terminal with Kitty keyboard protocol support (Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, foot) in TUI mode

**Code Folding**
- `za` — toggle fold; `zo` — open; `zc` — close; `zR` — open all
- Indentation-based fold detection
- `+` / `-` gutter indicators; entire gutter column is clickable
- Fold state is per-window (two windows on same buffer can have different folds)

**Hunk navigation (diff buffers)**
- `]c` / `[c` — jump to next/previous `@@` hunk in a `:Gdiff` buffer

---

### Multi-File Editing

**Buffers**
- `:bn` / `:bp` — next/previous buffer
- `:b#` — alternate buffer
- `:ls` — list buffers (shows `[Preview]` suffix for preview tabs)
- `:bd` — delete buffer

**Windows**
- `:split` / `:vsplit` — horizontal/vertical split
- `:close` — close window; `:only` — close all other windows

- `gt` / `gT` or `g` + `t` / `T` — next/previous tab
- `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` — MRU tab switcher popup (cycles most-recently-used tabs; Enter confirms, Escape cancels); release modifier to auto-confirm (GTK)
- `Alt+t` — MRU tab switcher (works in both TUI and GTK; hold Alt and press `t` to cycle; release Alt or wait 500ms to confirm in TUI)

**Editor Groups (VSCode-style split panes, recursive)**
- `Ctrl+\` — split editor right (any group can be split again for nested layouts)
- `Ctrl-W e` / `Ctrl-W E` — split editor right / down
- `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` — focus group by position (tree order)

---

### Project Search

- `Alt+F` — focus search panel (or click the search icon in the activity bar)
- Type a query and press `Enter` to search all text files under the project root
- Respects `.gitignore` rules (powered by the `ignore` crate — same walker as ripgrep)
- Hidden files/directories and binary files are skipped; results capped at 10,000
- Results are grouped by file (`filename.rs`) then listed as `  42: matched line text`
- **Toggle buttons** (VS Code style):
  - `Aa` — Match Case (case-sensitive search)
  - `Ab|` — Match Whole Word (`\b` word boundaries)
  - `.*` — Use Regular Expression (full regex syntax)
- **Replace across files:** type replacement text in the Replace input; click "Replace All" (GTK) or press `Enter` in the replace box / `Alt+H` (TUI) to substitute all matches on disk
  - Regex mode: `$1`, `$2` capture group backreferences work in replacement text
  - Literal mode: `$` in replacement is treated literally (no backreference expansion)
  - Files with unsaved changes (dirty buffers) are skipped and reported in the status message
  - Open buffers for modified files are automatically reloaded from disk after replace
- **GTK:** click toggle buttons below the search input; click a result to open the file; `Tab` or click to switch between search/replace inputs
- **TUI:** `Alt+C` (case), `Alt+W` (whole word), `Alt+R` (regex), `Alt+H` (replace all); `Tab` to switch between search/replace inputs; `j`/`k` to navigate results; `Enter` to open

---

### Fuzzy File Finder

- `Ctrl-P` (Normal mode) — open the Telescope-style fuzzy file picker
- A centered floating modal appears over the editor
- Type to instantly filter all project files by fuzzy subsequence match
- Word-boundary matches (after `/`, `_`, `-`, `.`) are scored higher
- `Ctrl-N` / `↓` and `Ctrl-P` / `↑` — navigate results; `Enter` — open selected file; `Escape` — close
- Results capped at 50; hidden dirs (`.git`, etc.) and `target/` are excluded

---

### Live Grep

- `Ctrl-G` (Normal mode) — show file info (Vim compat); live grep is available via `:grep` or configurable panel key `<C-g>`
- A centered floating two-column modal appears over the editor
- Type to instantly search file *contents* across the entire project (live-as-you-type, query ≥ 2 chars)
- Left pane shows results in `filename.rs:N: snippet` format; right pane shows ±5 context lines around the match
- Match line is highlighted in the preview pane
- `Ctrl-N` / `↓` and `Ctrl-P` / `↑` — navigate results; preview updates as you move; `Enter` — open file at match line; `Escape` — close
- Results capped at 200; uses `.gitignore`-aware search (same engine as project search panel)

---

### Quickfix Window

- `:grep <pattern>` / `:vimgrep <pattern>` — search project and populate the quickfix list; opens panel automatically
- `:copen` / `:cope` — open the quickfix panel with focus (shows all matches)
- `:cclose` / `:ccl` — close the quickfix panel
- `:cn` / `:cnext` — jump to next match (opens file, positions cursor)
- `:cp` / `:cprev` / `:cN` — jump to previous match
- `:cc N` — jump to Nth match (1-based)
- The quickfix panel is a **persistent bottom strip** (6 rows) above the status bar — not a floating modal
- When open with focus (`j`/`k`, `Ctrl-N`/`Ctrl-P` → navigate; `Enter` → jump and return focus to editor; `q`/`Escape` → close)

---

### Integrated Terminal

- `Ctrl-T` (Normal mode) — toggle the integrated terminal panel
- `:term` / `:terminal` — open a **new terminal tab** (always spawns a fresh shell, even if the panel is already open)
- The terminal is a **resizable bottom strip** (default 1 toolbar + 12 content rows) above the status bar; drag the header row up/down to resize; height persists across sessions
- Shell is determined by the `$SHELL` environment variable, falling back to `/bin/bash`; starts in the editor's working directory
- Full **ANSI/VT100 color support** — 256-color xterm palette rendered cell-by-cell
- **Multiple terminal tabs** — each tab runs an independent PTY; the toolbar shows `[1] [2] …` labels:
  - `Alt-1` through `Alt-9` (when terminal has focus) — switch to tab N
  - Click a `[N]` tab label in the toolbar — switch to that tab
  - Click the close icon (`󰅖`) — close the active tab; closes the panel if it was the last tab
  - When a shell exits (Ctrl-D, `exit`), its tab closes automatically
- **Mouse selection** — click and drag to select text in the terminal content area
- **Copy / Paste:**
  - `Ctrl-Y` — copy the current mouse selection to the system clipboard
  - `Ctrl-Shift-V` — paste from system clipboard into the running shell (GTK: intercepted by vimcode; TUI: Alacritty/kitty bracketed-paste is forwarded to the PTY automatically)
  - Mouse-release auto-copies the selection to the clipboard (requires `xclip` or `xsel` on Linux/X11)
- **Scrollback** — PageUp / PageDown scroll into history (up to 5 000 rows by default); the scrollbar is draggable; configurable via `"terminal_scrollback_lines"` in `settings.json`
- **Find in terminal** — `Ctrl-F` (while terminal has focus) opens an inline find bar in the toolbar row:
  - Type to set the query; matching text highlights live (orange = active match, amber = other matches)
  - `Enter` — next match; `Shift+Enter` — previous match; `Escape` or `Ctrl-F` — close find bar
  - Search is case-insensitive; covers all visible rows and the full scrollback history
- **Horizontal split** — click `󰤼` in the toolbar (or `Ctrl-W` when split is active) to toggle a side-by-side two-pane view:
  - Click either pane or press `Ctrl-W` to switch keyboard focus between panes
  - Drag the `│` divider left/right to resize the panes; both PTYs are resized on mouse release
- **Nerd Font toolbar** — tab strip + split (`󰤼`) and close (`󰅖`) icons
- **All keys forwarded to shell PTY** — Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-L, Ctrl-Z, arrow keys, Tab, etc. work as expected
- `Ctrl-T` while the terminal has focus **closes the panel** while keeping all shell sessions alive; reopening restores the same sessions
- When a shell exits (Ctrl-D, `exit`, etc.) its tab closes immediately; the panel closes automatically when the last tab exits; clicking outside the terminal returns focus to the editor

### Debugger (DAP)

Built-in Debug Adapter Protocol support with a VSCode-like UI. Open the debug sidebar (click the bug icon in the activity bar), set breakpoints with `F9`, and press `F5` to start debugging.

**Supported adapters** (installed via `:DapInstall <lang>`):

| Language | Adapter | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| Rust / C / C++ | codelldb | lldb |
| Python | debugpy | debugpy |
| Go | delve | go |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | js-debug | node |
| Java | java-debug | java |
| C# | netcoredbg | coreclr |

**Debug sidebar** — four interactive sections (Tab to switch, j/k to navigate, Enter to act, q/Escape to unfocus):
- **Variables** — local/scope variables with additional scope groups (e.g. Statics, Registers) as expandable headers; Enter expands/collapses nested children (recursive); C# private fields (`_name`, backing fields) automatically grouped under a collapsible **Non-Public Members** node
- **Watch** — user-defined watch expressions (`:DapWatch <expr>`); `x`/`d` removes selected
- **Call Stack** — all stack frames; Enter selects frame and navigates to source; active frame marked with `▶`
- **Breakpoints** — all set breakpoints with conditions shown; Enter jumps to location; `x`/`d` removes selected
- **Mouse** — click a section header to switch; click an item to select and activate it

**Conditional breakpoints** — breakpoints can have expression conditions, hit counts, or log messages:
- `:DapCondition <expr>` — stop only when `<expr>` is truthy (e.g. `:DapCondition x > 10`)
- `:DapHitCondition <count>` — stop after N hits (e.g. `:DapHitCondition >= 5`)
- `:DapLogMessage <msg>` — print message instead of stopping (logpoint)
- Run any command without arguments to clear the condition on the current line's breakpoint

**Bottom panel tabs** — `Terminal` and `Debug Output` tabs; debug output shows adapter diagnostics and program output with a scrollable history (mouse wheel + drag scrollbar; newest output shown at bottom by default).

**launch.json** — generated automatically in `.vimcode/launch.json` on first debug run; supports `${workspaceFolder}` substitution; existing `.vscode/launch.json` files are auto-migrated.

**tasks.json + preLaunchTask** — if a launch configuration has `"preLaunchTask": "build"`, VimCode loads `.vimcode/tasks.json` (auto-migrated from `.vscode/tasks.json`) and runs the matching task before starting the debug adapter. Task output appears in the Debug Output panel; if the task fails the debug session is aborted.

**Gutter indicators:**
- `●` — breakpoint set
- `◆` — conditional breakpoint (has condition or hit count)
- `▶` — current execution line (stopped)
- `◉` — breakpoint + current line

**Keys:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F5` | Start debugging / continue |
| `Shift+F5` | Stop debugging |
| `F9` | Toggle breakpoint on current line |
| `F10` | Step over |
| `F11` | Step into |
| `Shift+F11` | Step out |
| `F6` | Pause |

**Commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:DapInstall <lang>` | Install debug adapter for language |
| `:DapInfo` | Show detected DAP adapters |
| `:DapEval <expr>` | Evaluate expression in current frame |
| `:DapWatch <expr>` | Add watch expression |
| `:DapCondition [expr]` | Set/clear condition on breakpoint at cursor |
| `:DapHitCondition [count]` | Set/clear hit-count condition on breakpoint |
| `:DapLogMessage [msg]` | Set/clear logpoint on breakpoint at cursor |
| `:DapBottomPanel terminal\|output` | Switch bottom panel tab |

2. `]c` / `[c` — navigate between hunks
3. `gs` or `:Ghs` — stage the hunk under the cursor via `git apply --cached`

---

### Source Control Panel

Click the git branch icon in the activity bar to open the Source Control panel — a VSCode-style panel showing the full working tree status. The header shows the current branch plus ↑N↓N ahead/behind counts.

**Commit input row** (always visible, below the header):
- `c` — enter commit message input mode (row highlights, `|` cursor appears)
- Type your message; `BackSpace` deletes; `Escape` exits input mode (message is preserved)
- `Enter` — commits staged changes with the typed message (clears message on success)

**Four expandable sections** (Tab to collapse/expand):
- **Staged Changes** — files indexed for the next commit (`A` added, `M` modified, `D` deleted, `R` renamed)
- **Changes** — unstaged modifications and untracked files
- **Worktrees** — all git worktrees with ✓ marking the current one (hidden when no linked worktrees exist)
- **Recent Commits** — last 20 commit messages (`Enter` on an entry shows its hash + message in the status bar)

**Navigation and file actions:**
- `j` / `k` — move selection up/down
- `s` — stage/unstage the selected file; on a **section header**: stage all (Changes) or unstage all (Staged Changes)
- `d` — discard unstaged changes for the selected file (`git checkout -- <path>`)
- `D` — on the **Changes section header**: discard all unstaged changes (`git restore .`)
- `r` — refresh the panel
- `Enter` — open the selected file in the editor / switch to the selected worktree
- `Tab` — collapse/expand the current section
- `q` / `Escape` — return focus to the editor

**Remote operations (from panel):**
- `p` — push current branch
- `P` — pull current branch
- `f` — fetch

**Worktree and remote commands:**

| Command | Alias | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `:GWorktreeAdd <branch> <path>` | — | Add a new git worktree at `<path>` for `<branch>` |
| `:GWorktreeRemove <path>` | — | Remove the worktree at `<path>` |
| `:Gpull` | `:Gpl` | Pull current branch |
| `:Gfetch` | `:Gf` | Fetch |

### Workspaces

A `.vimcode-workspace` file at the project root captures folder settings and enables per-project session restoration.

**Opening a folder or workspace:**
- **GTK:** File → "Open Folder…" / "Open Workspace…" / "Open Recent…" → native file dialog or recent-workspaces picker
- **TUI:** same menu actions open a fuzzy directory picker or recent-workspaces list modal
- **Commands:** `:OpenFolder <path>`, `:OpenWorkspace <path>`, `:SaveWorkspaceAs <path>`, `:cd <path>`, `:OpenRecent`

**Workspace file format** (`.vimcode-workspace`):
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "folders": [{"path": "."}],
  "settings": { "tabstop": 2, "expandtab": true }
}
```
Settings in the workspace file overlay your global `settings.json`.

**Per-project sessions** — the session (open files, cursor/scroll positions) is stored per-directory using a stable hash of the workspace root path (`~/.config/vimcode/sessions/<hash>.json`). The session is saved on quit and restored automatically the next time you open the same folder. Opening a new or different directory always starts with a clean editor — files from other projects are never carried over.

**Settings overlay** — workspace settings in `.vimcode-workspace` are applied on top of your global `settings.json`. When you switch to a different folder, the overlay is reverted so your global settings are restored. Per-folder `.vimcode/settings.json` files work the same way.

### Lua Plugin Extensions

VimCode embeds Lua 5.4 (via `mlua`, fully vendored — no system Lua required). Plugins live in `~/.config/vimcode/plugins/` as `.lua` files or directories with `init.lua`.

**API surface** (`vimcode.*` global):

```lua
-- Event hooks
vimcode.on("save",        function(path) end)     -- fired after :w (also "BufWrite")
vimcode.on("open",        function(path) end)     -- fired on file open
vimcode.on("cursor_move", function(line_col) end) -- fired when cursor moves (arg: "line,col")
vimcode.on("BufEnter",    function() end)          -- fired when switching to a buffer
vimcode.on("BufNew",      function() end)          -- fired when a new buffer is created
vimcode.on("InsertEnter", function() end)          -- fired on entering insert mode
vimcode.on("InsertLeave", function() end)          -- fired on leaving insert mode
vimcode.on("ModeChanged", function(change) end)    -- arg: "Old:New" (e.g. "Normal:Insert")
vimcode.on("VimEnter",    function() end)          -- fired once after startup
vimcode.on("panel_focus", function(name) end)      -- custom panel gained focus
vimcode.on("panel_select",function(arg) end)       -- Enter pressed on panel item
vimcode.on("panel_action",function(arg) end)       -- other key pressed on panel item

-- Custom commands / key mappings
vimcode.command("MyCmd", function(args) end)
vimcode.keymap("n", "<leader>x", function() end)   -- normal mode
vimcode.keymap("i", "<C-Space>", function() end)   -- insert mode
vimcode.keymap("v", "X", function() end)            -- visual mode
vimcode.keymap("c", "Y", function() end)            -- command mode

-- Editor API
vimcode.message(text)         -- show in status bar
vimcode.cwd()                 -- current working directory string
vimcode.command_run(cmd)      -- execute a VimCode : command
vimcode.async_shell(cmd, event [, opts])  -- run shell command in background thread;
                              -- result delivered as plugin event(event, stdout)
                              -- opts: { stdin = "...", cwd = "..." }

-- Buffer API (current active buffer)
vimcode.buf.lines()              -- all lines as table
vimcode.buf.line(n)              -- line n (1-indexed) or nil
vimcode.buf.set_line(n, text)    -- replace line n (undoable)
vimcode.buf.insert_line(n, text) -- insert text before line n
vimcode.buf.delete_line(n)       -- delete line n
vimcode.buf.set_cursor(line,col) -- move cursor (1-indexed, clamped)
vimcode.buf.path()               -- file path string or nil
vimcode.buf.line_count()         -- integer
vimcode.buf.cursor()             -- {line, col} (1-indexed)
vimcode.buf.annotate_line(n, s)  -- show virtual text after line n
vimcode.buf.clear_annotations()  -- remove all virtual text

-- Settings API
vimcode.opt.get(key)             -- get setting value as string
vimcode.opt.set(key, value)      -- set setting (applied after callback)

-- State API (read-only queries)
vimcode.state.mode()             -- "Normal", "Insert", "Visual", etc.
vimcode.state.filetype()         -- language ID string (e.g. "rust")
vimcode.state.register(char)     -- {content, linewise} or nil
vimcode.state.set_register(char, content, linewise)  -- write register
vimcode.state.mark(char)         -- {line, col} (1-indexed) or nil

-- Git API (synchronous subprocess calls)
vimcode.git.blame_line(n)        -- {hash,author,date,relative_date,message} or nil
vimcode.git.blame_file()         -- [{hash,author,...}, ...] for entire buffer
vimcode.git.log_file(limit)      -- [{hash,message}, ...] for current file
vimcode.git.file_log_detailed(n) -- [{hash,author,date,message,stat}, ...]
vimcode.git.line_log(s, e, n)    -- commits touching line range [s,e]
vimcode.git.log(limit)           -- repo-wide commit log
vimcode.git.show(hash)           -- full git show output (string or nil)
vimcode.git.diff_ref(ref)        -- diff against branch/tag/ref (string or nil)
vimcode.git.repo_root()          -- repository root path (string or nil)
vimcode.git.branch()             -- current branch name (string or nil)
vimcode.git.stash_list()         -- [{index,message,branch}, ...]
vimcode.git.stash_push(msg)      -- push to stash
vimcode.git.stash_pop(index)     -- pop stash entry
vimcode.git.stash_show(index)    -- stash diff (string or nil)
vimcode.git.branches()           -- [{name,tracking,is_current}, ...] branch list

-- Panel API (register custom sidebar panels from extensions)
vimcode.panel.register(name, opts)         -- register a new sidebar panel
  -- opts: { icon = "X", sections = {"Sec1", "Sec2"}, on_focus = fn }
vimcode.panel.set_items(name, section, items) -- populate section with items
  -- items: {{label="...", hint="...", icon="X", style="normal|dim|bold"}, ...}
vimcode.panel.parse_event(arg)             -- parse "key:context" event argument
```

**Example plugin** (`~/.config/vimcode/plugins/hello.lua`):
```lua
vimcode.command("Hello", function(args)
  vimcode.message("Hello from Lua! " .. args)
end)

vimcode.on("save", function(path)
  vimcode.message("Saved: " .. path)
end)
```
Then `:Hello world` shows "Hello from Lua! world" in the status bar.

**Plugin management commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:Plugin list` | Show all loaded plugins and their status |
| `:Plugin reload` | Reload all plugins from disk |
| `:Plugin enable <name>` | Enable a previously disabled plugin |
| `:Plugin disable <name>` | Disable a plugin (persisted in settings) |
| `:Comment [N]` | Toggle comment on N lines from cursor (core feature, 46+ languages; `:Commentary` alias) |
| `:map` | List all user-defined key mappings |
| `:map n <C-/> :Comment` | Add a key mapping (persisted to settings.json) |
| `:unmap n <C-/>` | Remove a key mapping |

Plugins are loaded in alphabetical order on startup. Security: plugins have unrestricted file and process access (same trust model as Neovim).

### Language Extensions

Language extensions bundle an LSP server, optional DAP debugger, and Lua scripts into a single named package. When you open a file for a language that has a known extension but no LSP server installed, the status bar shows a one-line hint:

```
No C# Language Support extension — :ExtInstall csharp  (N to dismiss)
```

**Available extensions** (fetched from the [vimcode-ext](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode-ext) registry):

| Extension | Language | LSP | DAP |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----|
| `csharp` | C# / .NET | csharp-ls | netcoredbg |
| `python` | Python | pyright | debugpy |
| `rust` | Rust | rust-analyzer | codelldb |
| `javascript` | JS / TypeScript | typescript-language-server | — |
| `go` | Go | gopls | delve |
| `java` | Java | jdtls | — |
| `cpp` | C / C++ | clangd | codelldb |
| `php` | PHP | intelephense | — |
| `ruby` | Ruby | ruby-lsp | — |
| `bash` | Bash | bash-language-server | — |
| `json` | JSON | vscode-json-languageserver | — |
| `xml` | XML | lemminx | — |
| `yaml` | YAML | yaml-language-server | — |
| `markdown` | Markdown | marksman | — |
| `terraform` | Terraform | terraform-ls | — |
| `bicep` | Bicep | bicep-langserver | — |
| `git-insights` | (all files) | — | — |

Extensions are fetched from a remote GitHub registry on startup and cached locally at `~/.config/vimcode/registry_cache.json` for offline/instant startup. You can also develop and test extensions locally — see [Writing a Local Extension](#writing-a-local-extension) below.

**Extensions sidebar panel** — click the extensions icon (󱧅) in the activity bar to open a VSCode-style panel with two sections:
- **INSTALLED** — extensions currently installed; press `Enter` to view info, `d` to remove
- **AVAILABLE** — all registry and local extensions; press `Enter` or `i` to install
- `/` — activate search input to filter both sections; `Escape` exits search, `q`/`Escape` unfocuses panel
- `j` / `k` — navigate items; `r` — refresh registry from GitHub; `Tab` — collapse/expand section

**Extension commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:ExtInstall <name>` | Install LSP + DAP + extract Lua scripts |
| `:ExtRemove <name>` | Unmark extension as installed + delete its Lua scripts (LSP binary untouched) |
| `:ExtList` | Show all extensions and their install status |
| `:ExtEnable <name>` | Re-enable a disabled extension |
| `:ExtDisable <name>` | Suppress install prompts for this extension |
| `:ExtRefresh` | Fetch the latest extension list from the GitHub registry |

**Git Insights extension** — when installed, shows inline blame annotations as dim virtual text at the end of the cursor's current line (runs `git blame` asynchronously via `vimcode.async_shell()` so the UI never blocks):

```
42  let result = compute();   Alice • 3 days ago • fix off-by-one
```

Also provides these commands (all open results in scratch buffers):

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:GitLog` | Show recent commits for the current file in status bar |
| `:GitFileHistory` | File commit history with author, date, stats in vertical split |
| `:GitShow [hash]` | Show commit details (reads hash from cursor line if omitted) |
| `:GitLineHistory` | Log of commits touching the current line |
| `:GitDiff [ref]` | Diff against a ref (default: HEAD) |
| `:GitRepoLog` | Repository-wide commit log (last 200 commits) |
| `:GitStash [msg]` | Push changes to stash |
| `:GitStashPop [n]` | Pop stash entry (default: 0) |
| `:GitStashList` | Show all stash entries |
| `:GitStashShow [n]` | Show stash diff |

**Git Log panel** — the git-insights extension also registers a custom sidebar panel (via `vimcode.panel.register()`) with three sections: **Branches**, **Log**, and **Stash**. Click the git log icon in the activity bar to browse branches, recent commits, and stash entries interactively. Press `Enter` on a commit to view it, or on a stash entry to show its diff.

#### Writing a Local Extension

You can develop and test extensions locally without publishing to the registry. Create a directory under `~/.config/vimcode/extensions/` with a `manifest.toml`:

```
~/.config/vimcode/extensions/my-extension/
├── manifest.toml        # Required: extension metadata
├── my_script.lua        # Optional: Lua plugin script(s)
└── README.md            # Optional: shown when pressing Enter in Extensions panel
```

Local extensions appear automatically in the Extensions sidebar alongside registry extensions. Install with `:ExtInstall my-extension` to activate. Scripts already on disk are not re-downloaded.

For the full manifest schema and Lua API reference, see the [Extension Development Guide](https://github.com/JDonaghy/vimcode-ext/blob/main/EXTENSIONS.md).

**Self-hosted registry:** Set `extension_registry_url` in settings to point to your own `registry.json` URL (same format as the official registry).

### AI Assistant

Built-in AI chat panel powered by Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or a local Ollama model. Click the chat icon in the activity bar (or configure a keybinding) to open the panel.

**Supported providers** (configured in `settings.json`):

| Provider | Default model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `anthropic` | `claude-opus-4-5` | Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ai_api_key` in settings |
| `openai` | `gpt-4o` | Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ai_api_key` in settings |
| `ollama` | `llama3` | Runs locally; `ai_base_url` defaults to `http://localhost:11434` |

**Usage:**
- Click the chat icon (``) in the activity bar to open the AI sidebar panel
- `i` — enter input mode; type a message and press `Enter` to send
- `j` / `k` — scroll conversation history
- `Escape` / `q` — exit input mode / unfocus panel
- `:AI <message>` — send a message directly from command mode
- `:AiClear` — clear the conversation history

**Settings** (in `settings.json`):

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `ai_provider` | `"anthropic"` | AI provider: `"anthropic"`, `"openai"`, or `"ollama"` |
| `ai_api_key` | `""` | API key (falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` env vars) |
| `ai_model` | `""` | Model override (leave empty for provider default) |
| `ai_base_url` | `""` | Base URL override (used for Ollama; defaults to `http://localhost:11434`) |
| `ai_completions` | `false` | Enable AI inline completions (ghost text) in insert mode |

Responses are fetched asynchronously via a background `curl` subprocess — no async runtime required. The conversation is kept in memory for the session and cleared with `:AiClear`.

#### AI Inline Completions

When `ai_completions` is enabled, VimCode shows ghost text at the cursor while you type in insert mode. After ~250 ms of idle time a fill-in-the-middle request is sent to the configured AI provider; the suggestion appears as dimmed text. Multi-line suggestions show all continuation lines as ghost text beneath the cursor line.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Accept the ghost-text suggestion |
| `Alt-]` | Cycle to next alternative suggestion |
| `Alt-[` | Cycle to previous alternative suggestion |
| Any other key | Dismiss the suggestion |

---

### LSP Support (Language Server Protocol)

Automatic language server integration — open a file and diagnostics, completions, go-to-definition, and hover just work if the appropriate server is on `PATH`. LSP initializes on every file-opening path: `:e`, sidebar click, fuzzy finder (Ctrl-P), live grep confirm, `:split`/`:vsplit`, and `:tabnew`.

**Built-in server registry** (auto-detected on `PATH`):

| Language | Server(s) tried in order |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` |
| Python | `pyright-langserver` → `basedpyright-langserver` → `pylsp` → `jedi-language-server` |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `typescript-language-server` |
| Go | `gopls` |
| C / C++ | `clangd` |

**Features:**
- **Inline diagnostics** — wavy underlines (GTK) / colored underlines (TUI) with severity-colored gutter icons
- **Diagnostic navigation** — `]d` / `[d` jump to next/previous diagnostic
- **LSP completions** — async source for the auto-popup (appears as you type); `Ctrl-Space` manually triggers
- **Go-to-definition** — `gd` jumps to the definition of the symbol under the cursor
- **Find references** — `gr` populates quickfix list with all usage sites; single result jumps directly
- **Go-to-implementation** — `gi` jumps to the implementation of the symbol
- **Go-to-type-definition** — `gy` jumps to the type definition
- **Hover info** — `K` shows type/documentation popup above the cursor
- **Signature help** — popup appears above cursor when typing `(` or `,` in a function call; active parameter highlighted
- **LSP formatting** — `<leader>gf` (or `:Lformat`) formats the whole buffer; single undo step reverts
- **LSP rename** — `<leader>rn` pre-fills `:Rename <word>` in command bar; `:Rename <newname>` renames across all files
- **Semantic token highlighting** — overlays LSP `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` on tree-sitter; 8 distinct colors for parameters, properties, namespaces, enum members, interfaces, type parameters, decorators, and macros; bold for declarations, italic for readonly/static
- **Diagnostic counts** — `E:N W:N` shown in status bar

**Commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:LspInfo` | Show running servers and their status |
| `:LspRestart` | Restart server for current file type |
| `:LspStop` | Stop server for current file type |
| `:LspInstall <lang>` | Redirect to `:ExtInstall <name>` (use `:ExtInstall` directly) |
| `:Lformat` | Format current buffer via LSP |
| `:Rename <name>` | Rename symbol under cursor across all files |

**Settings:**
- `:set lsp` / `:set nolsp` — enable/disable LSP (default: enabled)
- Custom servers in `settings.json`:
```json
{
    "lsp_servers": [
        { "command": "lua-language-server", "args": [], "languages": ["lua"] }
    ]
}
```

- `:Settings` — open `settings.json` in a new editor tab for direct editing; saved changes reload automatically in both GTK and TUI backends.
- **Settings sidebar (GTK + TUI)** — click the gear icon in the activity bar to open a VSCode-style settings form: searchable list of all settings grouped by category (Appearance, Editor, Search, Workspace, LSP, Terminal, Plugins, AI) with interactive controls; GTK uses native widgets (Switch, SpinButton, DropDown, Entry), TUI renders `[✓]`/`[ ]` toggles, `value ▸` cycling enums, and inline text/number editing with Ctrl+V paste; changes apply and save immediately; colorscheme picker includes custom VSCode themes from `~/.config/vimcode/themes/`. **User Keymaps** row opens a scratch buffer editor (`:Keymaps`) — one keymap per line in `mode keys :command` format; `:w` validates and saves back to `settings.keymaps`.

**Panel navigation key bindings** — configurable in `settings.json` under `"panel_keys"`:

| Field | Default | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `trigger` | `<C-Space>` | Manually trigger the completion popup |
| `accept` | `Tab` | Accept the highlighted completion item |

Only specify keys you want to change — unspecified keys keep their defaults.

**User key mappings** — define custom key → command bindings. Works in both Vim and VSCode modes.

**Discovering command names:** Run `:Keybindings` (or press F1 → "Open Keybinding Reference") to see all keybindings. Remappable bindings show their command name on the right — e.g. `gd → :def`, `F12 → :def`, `Ctrl+P → :fuzzy`.

**Adding a mapping:**
- `:map n <key> :command` — add from the command line
- `:Keymaps` (or F1 → "Open Keyboard Shortcuts") — open a persistent editor, one mapping per line, `:w` to save

```json
"keymaps": [
  "n <C-/> :Comment",
  "v <C-/> :Comment",
  "n gcc :Comment {count}",
  "n <leader>f :Lformat"
]
```

Format: `"mode keys :command"` where:
- **mode**: `n` (normal), `v` (visual), `i` (insert), `c` (command). In VSCode mode, use `n`.
- **keys**: single char (`J`), modifier (`<C-/>`, `<A-c>`), or multi-key sequence (`gcc`, `gc`)
- **action**: ex command prefixed with `:`. Use `{count}` to substitute the count prefix.

User keymaps are checked **before** built-in keys, so they can override defaults. Multi-key sequences (e.g. `gcc`) are supported — intermediate keys are buffered until an exact match or fallthrough.

### VSCode Mode

Switch the editor into a **non-modal editing** mode that works like a standard text editor:

- `:set mode=vscode` — activate VSCode mode (from Vim normal mode)
- `Alt-M` — toggle between Vim mode and VSCode mode at any time
- `:set mode=vim` — return to Vim mode

**In VSCode mode:**
- Always in "insert" state — no mode switching
- `Ctrl-C` / `Ctrl-X` — copy / cut (no selection → copies/cuts whole current line)
- `Ctrl-V` — paste
- `Ctrl-Z` / `Ctrl-Y` — undo / redo
- `Ctrl-A` — select all
- `Ctrl-S` — save
- `Ctrl-/` — toggle line comment (language-aware, 46+ languages)
- `Shift+Arrow` — extend selection one character/line at a time
- `Ctrl+Arrow` — move by word
- `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` — extend selection by word
- `Home` — smart home (first non-whitespace; again → col 0)
- `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` — extend selection to line start/end
- `Escape` — clear selection (stays in insert)
- `Ctrl-Q` — quit
- `F1` — command palette (search and run any command)
- `F10` — toggle menu bar visibility
- Typing while a selection is active **replaces** the selection
- Status bar shows `EDIT  F1:palette  Alt-M:vim` (or `SELECT` when text is selected, `COMMAND` in command bar)

**Line Operations (Phase 1):**
- `Alt+Up` / `Alt+Down` — move line or selection up/down
- `Alt+Shift+Up` / `Alt+Shift+Down` — duplicate line or selection up/down
- `Ctrl+Shift+K` — delete entire line
- `Ctrl+Enter` — insert blank line below (cursor stays)
- `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` — insert blank line above (cursor stays)
- `Ctrl+L` — select current line (repeat to extend)

**Multi-Cursor + Indentation (Phase 2):**
- `Ctrl+D` — select word under cursor; repeat to add next occurrence
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` — select all occurrences of the current word
- `Ctrl+]` — indent line/selection
- `Ctrl+[` — outdent line/selection
- `Shift+Tab` — outdent

**Quick Navigation + Panels (Phase 3):**
- `Ctrl+G` — go to line number
- `Ctrl+P` — quick file open (fuzzy finder)
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `F1` — command palette
- `Ctrl+B` — toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl+J` — toggle terminal panel
- `` Ctrl+` `` — toggle terminal panel
- `Ctrl+,` — open settings

**Custom keybindings:**
VSCode mode supports the same `:map` remapping system as Vim mode. To remap a key:
1. Press **F1** → type "keybinding" → select **"Open Keybinding Reference"** to see all bindings with their command names
2. Press **F1** → type "keyboard" → select **"Open Keyboard Shortcuts"** to add custom mappings
3. Add a line like `n <C-H> :hover` or `n <F7> :def`, then save

Use modifier keys (`<C-x>`, `<A-x>`, `<F5>`) to avoid intercepting normal typing. The mode is always `n` for VSCode keymaps.

The `editor_mode` setting is persisted in `settings.json`.

---

### Session Persistence

All state lives in `~/.config/vimcode/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `settings.json` | Editor options |
| `session.json` | Open files, cursor/scroll positions, history, window geometry |

- **Open files restored on startup** — each file reopened in its own tab; files closed via `:q` are excluded next session
- **Cursor + scroll position** — restored per file on reopen
- **Command history** — Up/Down arrows in command mode; max 100 entries; `Ctrl-R` reverse incremental search
- **Search history** — Up/Down arrows in search mode; max 100 entries
- **Tab auto-completion** in command mode
- **Window geometry** — size saved on close, restored on startup
- **Explorer visibility** — open/closed state persisted

---

### Rendering

**Syntax highlighting** (Tree-sitter, auto-detected by extension)
- Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Go, C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Bash, JSON, TOML, CSS, YAML, HTML

**Line numbers** — absolute / relative / hybrid (both on = hybrid)

**Scrollbars** (GTK + TUI)
- Per-window vertical scrollbar with cursor position indicator
- Per-window horizontal scrollbar (shown when content is wider than viewport)
- Scrollbar click-to-jump and drag support

**Font** — configurable family and size via `settings.json`

---

### TUI Backend (Terminal UI)

Full editor in the terminal via ratatui + crossterm — feature-parity with GTK.

- **Layout:** activity bar (3 cols) | sidebar | editor area; status line + command line full-width at bottom
- **Sidebar:** same file explorer as GTK with Nerd Font icons
- **Mouse support:** click-to-position, double-click word select, click-and-drag visual selection, window switching, scroll wheel (targets pane under cursor), scrollbar click-to-jump and drag; drag event coalescing for smooth scrollbar tracking; bracketed paste support
- **Sidebar resize:** drag separator column; `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` keyboard resize (min 15, max 60 cols)
- **Scrollbars:** `█` / `░` thumb/track in uniform grey; vsplit separator doubles as left-pane vertical scrollbar; horizontal scrollbar row when content wider than viewport; `┘` corner when both axes present
- **Scroll sync:** `:Gblame` pairs stay in sync across keyboard nav and mouse events
- **Frame rate cap:** renders limited to ~60fps so rapid LSP or search events don't peg the CPU
- **Cursor shapes:** bar `|` in Insert mode, underline `_` in replace (`r`)

**Design rule:** `src/core/` has zero GTK/rendering dependencies and is testable in isolation.


## Acknowledgements
VimCode is built on the shoulders of giants, and I take very little credit for it. Credit belongs instead to the following people and teams:

*   **Bram Moolenaar (RIP):** The original author of Vim. If you use VimCode and want to give something back, you can honor his legacy by donating to a charity of your choice. See [moolenaar.net/Charityware.html](https://www.moolenaar.net). I personally believe in the mission of UNICEF. No pressure!
*   **The VSCode Team:** Obviously.
*   **Bill Joy:** The creator of the original vi editor.
*   **LLM Pioneers:** I also feel the need to begrudgingly acknowledge the work done by those who helped create LLMs (too many to mention). I say "begrudgingly" because of the horrors of "AI Slop" unleashed on the world, not to mention the environmental concerns regarding power-hungry data centers. That said, I remain hopeful that AI will be a catalyst for generating unlimited clean energy and many other benefits as well. I just hope that too many people won't suffer because of the incredible pace of the disruption.
*   **Boris Cherny:** The creator of **Claude Code**, who is probably putting all of us developers out of a job any day now.
